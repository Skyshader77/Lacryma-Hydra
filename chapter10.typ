The day has yet to come. A phrase she has repeated to herself every night for the past eight years. It symbolized both disappointment and relief. Nix’s sleeping form was always a delight to dig one eyes’ into. In all the years Serena had spent wandering across the Known World, she never imagined life would find a novel way to test her. Why did the Gatekeeper grant Nix that voice, that smile, those brown eyes that had pained her, that laugh? Another mystery the enigma that was life wanted Serena to solve.

Beyond the windows of the Palace Complex, children ruled the Known World, a constant she had to adapt to. Older kids would rip apart other children’s families, sending the youngest to war to die for another child’s toy. They would marry each other before tiring of their spouses akin to worn playthings. They would denigrate their parents, children nonetheless, before wallowing in regret at their own mistakes. Such was the state of this world that had become a garden for newborn to centenarian infants.

In the garden of humanity, the Magi had bloomed the brightest, their vigorous roots absorbing with astonishing efficiency any nutrients the Forgotten Gods sprinkled on the ground. To the non-Magi that injustice was something that had riled Serena throughout her life. With magic, the Magi’s flowers flaunted their petals which espoused all colors of the rainbows. Their anthuriums, celosias, birds of paradise had illuminated the world with their celestial beauty indescribable to any modern human. For the floating libraries found in the Sunken Continent ensured supremacy. The tulips, lotuses and lilies of the non-Magi had long been accustomed to yielding water and food to the more ravishing plants whose use of dragons asserted a near unquestioned dominance. It was under these circumstances that Serena had uprooted the anthuriums, celosias, birds of paradise, the prestige and pride of a bygone time, the zenith of human opportunism. The Known World today was forged under the auspices of fairness and equity. Or so what she thought when she met Nix.

Nix whose plumage could be unmatched in its beauty and danger. Nix who had been the first Magi to have been born in a millennium. The first flower to have survived the manmade extinction. To have someone who shared a similar upbringing, someone who felt the intricacies that magic did to one’s body, the sensations that can make one reach a heightened plane, one above the rest of the children’s existence. To break the monotony of humanity. Yes, she missed that shareable sentiment.

"Do you find sword fights enjoyable?" had asked Nix the other night.

Her ability to withhold the truth had been challenged a staggering amount of times with Nix and Claradore. They would find the strength to forgive her or so she hoped. How difficult it was to restrain one from shedding tears when the last two Magi had crossed blood in the imperial gardens away from privy eyes. How onerous it was to stay silent on their flawed techniques. Flawed but tantalizing. Magi had poured their essence and survival into this sculpture of the body. The blood was both the chisel and the stone. Her son had been right. Depriving humanity of the most grandiose of all art forms was reprehensible.

"What do you expect out of mastering that skill? Vengeance?" Serena had asked in the Elysian Tongue. Her voice had slipped. It gave off this aristocratic accent, a trace of her mother tongue. Claradore’s eyes had held a glimmer of doubt. Had she spoken in the Forgotten Tongue, this feverish dream would have collapsed akin to a house of cards. That was out of the question.

"Pumpkin face! Do you want to duel good old me and my dagger next!" Serena had corrected herself in the Imperial Tongue with the Rauthengardian accent Nix and Claradore were accustomed to hearing. Claradore had blinked. With enough luck, this would be seen as a figment of his imagination.

"I never imagined you to adore suffering," had Nix.

And so she had dueled Nix on that day, remembering how a blood blade can shatter steel with ease. Yet she had done well for someone who had not had the pleasure of fighting a Magi in years. Serena had smiled as she had bent down to avoid Nix’ thrusts. They had danced, with Nix leading the duo, this puzzle of intentions that she delighted in playing. A duel was a contest of predictions where a split second mistake costed one a limb or a life. Eyes met, the same look at that day. Even the scent had been replicated with cruel accuracy. The tease of Nix’ lips creeping closer to Serena’s was insufferable as it had been on that day. The Gatekeeper’s designs with Nix were shrouded in obscurity. Only through walking Nix’ mortal life hand to hand could Serena hope to decipher whatever intentions he had for her. Serena and Nix had spun and spun, their movements interlocked in flurries and parries.

To perpetuate the masquerade, Serena had let herself slip on the grass. Letting a Magi seize victory from the jaws of defeat. Her younger self would have never forgiven her. Nix’ blood blade had flirted with her throat.

Claradore had clapped.

"The lady Serena claims she had never trifled with Magi yet you never landed a blow on her, my dear," had said Claradore to Nix.

"The spectator has no right to criticize the choices of the performer from his high seat," had answered Nix. She had pointed her blood blade towards him.

"My dear, I do not take pleasure in defeating girls who have not seen their twentieth summer."

Children. To Serena, Claradore and Nix were but children. Children who did not comprehend the significance of the spider tattoos they had eagerly stamped on their young bodies. Tattoos whose importance had been buried at the end of the Age of Magic. To further complicate matters, there was the question of that medallion. Serena did not have to unlock it. The contents were obvious to herself. It would only serve as a confirmation for the inevitable course of action.

"I would prefer not to harm sir Claradore’s shiny pectorals. Pumpkin face here told me a painter would come when the rooster calls."

Nix never missed any chance to berate Claradore’s painting sessions. If Nix were to taken at face value, the man’s caprices were worthy of derision. For this reformed Red Guild, there existed a doctrine claiming that clothes exerted an unbearable constraint on the human body. While it was true that one should be free of any inner doubts to cast magic, this interpretation of the Magi’s philosophy was an experiment. Hence, Serena and Nix had either the pleasure or the horror of watching Claradore grace the Emperor’s presence naked. Scantily clothed male and female virgins laid in his arms much to the ire of Princess Livia and the late Cardinal Innocentus.

"I insist," had said Nix.

"What do you offer for this performance, my dear?"

"A performance of my own in front of the Emperor."

"A wise proposition."

Some bones and organs deep within Serena would have answered the summons to arms. Alas her mind warned her about the pitfalls of confronting a child with the temperament of her past opponents. Would she have the willpower To keep the truth from leaking? It had been ages. The last battlefield she had sleepwalked into never failed to reappear in her dreams. Men in their cuirass swam in rivers of blood seeking her foes. Whenever she went, they had followed with the blinding loyalty of dogs. What started with a glimmer of reconciliation collapsed into a war had eternized. Serena had remembered sitting atop a pile of corpses as she had always did. A lone soldier faced her. One that has always looked magnificent in that sapphire cape and that plumed helmet. One that her words and screams had never reached. One that she could never hold in her arms again. A wily one that had turned the blade that were her imperfections against her. Mother, he had said as he unsheathed his sword. Son, she had said, hearing his heartbeat for the last time.

"I am tired, pumpkin face...Another day?" had said Serena.

Serena had given Nix that disarming gaze, echoing the one puppies such as Spartak used against their owners. Nix had groaned in her characteristic manner: adorable and sisterly.

It was these memories that made Serena relive her distant youth. Life had stagnated without Magi to stir its pot. One had to relish these moments before the memory of their brutal end brought one back to self-pity. Serena opened the windows to hers and Nix’ room. On the bed, Nix snored softly next to Spartak or rather she was being cuddled by the beast’s thirteen greater palms frame. Nix had told Serena that it was a direwolf, a most ludicrous affirmation.

#emph[Some things are better learned through hardships.]

Serena jumped, head first. Winds buffeted her face. Eight floors beneath her, a constellation of torches navigated the streets of Thanatopolis, ignorant of the struggles and sacrifices of the generations before them. It was better this way Her blood erupted from her spine with the ferocity of an ancient geyser. Snow-white feathers aggregated around two set of wings. She flew, feeling the air trickling over her shoulders and legs akin to a glorious dove.
