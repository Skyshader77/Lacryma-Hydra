"Seek the Emperor who Never Was in the Studion and the medallion will be opened," had said Claradore.

It had been easy to say from the throne, this seat Claradore had gotten accustomed to. For the Empire’s decrees, proclamations and edicts were funneled into his desk. The elderly phoenix ailed, sulking in its deathbed. The chicks were not of age. Nix knew Claradore would need her to be his ears against the vultures that wanted to pilfer the phoenix’ nest and seize its treasures for themselves.

"Do you think Claradore will do it?" asked Serena as they walked in the colonnaded street carving the Studion in two. Merchants tempted Nix’ nose with those lobster and shrimp dumplings she had gotten addicted to. Children enjoyed their innocence underneath Charov’s Aqueduct. Adults bickered over the racers who competed at the Hippodrome. Nix and Serena floated in this sea of mules, carts, oxen and people who called Thanatopolis their home.

"Only the purple born may claim it."

"Or someone commanding the army."

"The Medean Empire would never elevate a half Molochian such as Ordogan on the throne no matter how many titles they heap on him."

"There is no other choice, Phoenix Egg."

"The Prince can be raised under the spider’s web."

"Then why don’t you tell Claradore’s ass to stop warming the throne?"

They reached the portico of Zhapur’s Clinic where Serena parted ways with Nix. She removed her sandals at entrance before lounging in the living room, contemplating the Elysian tapestries and their elaborate fire motifs. A broiled lamb was being rotated above the fireplace, Nix having to stop Spartak from heading to that room. The last thing she wanted was her dog’s jaws ravaging someone’s else dinner.

The Elysian Tongue could make ordering food look like a passionate argument. At least that was what Nix thought when Zhapur’s wife, Leila, asked him to prepare the vegetables for their supper.

"You have brought the silphium?" asked Zhapur. He bore this long grey beard that all Elysian men of his age adored. Nix smiled at him as he was dressed in the plain brown tunic sewn with flame embroidery that she and Claradore had made for him.

"Of course, Spartak!"

Her dog came to her, dangling two baskets full of silphium for Zhapur to collect. Outside in the garden, women who had consumed silphium laid on mats, Zhapur’s vast collection of painted marble statues keeping them company. Nix never understood how having Emperor Marro stare at them with his fierce eyes could relieve them of pain. One of the first things that Nix had learned when she first came to the imperial capital was that there were actually doctors dedicated to what Baba once did. How could anyone treat more than one patient at once was beyond her.

"The Firstborn’s Flame be strong, you and Claradore are have acted as our saviors again,"said Zhapur.

"The pleasure is mine, doctor. How fares your daughter?"

If there was one person who was more knowledgeable than Claradore in medicine, it would be Zhapur. It seemed the man had managed to cram his brain with hundred books on human anatomy and on diseases. The quantities to make potions for infections had been memorized to the closest droplet. Zhapur could also smell sickness with clinical accuracy, something neither Baba nor Claradore could do. #emph[Elysians...] Perhaps Nix should not indulge in such stereotypes.

"She has almost mastered the Classical Tongue. Unfortunately, mathematics are not her strong suit," said Zhapur.

"Something she inherited from her poor, poor, poor father," chimed Leila, entering from the garden. Nix smelled her jasmine-infused dried fruits, this caravan of myrrh and cinnamon that constituted the typical Elysian fragrance.

"My love! You had promised to not embarrass me in front of the guests!"

Leila kissed him on the cheeks before sitting down herself.

"Claradore told me you are planning to leave for Noein next year?" said Nix.

"My husband prefers a more temperate climate. You should have seen him at the first snowfall, glued to the fire while our daughter made her first snowball," said Leila.

"Thanatopolis will miss you two. There isn’t anyone in the streets that does not know about Zhapur’s Clinic and its erotic paintings," said Nix while pointing to the obscure work of art depicting three men in alluring positions. Claradore had spend at least ten minutes observing the scene the last time he came here.

"Our offer for you still stands. Come with us, Nix. You already know much about herbs. We can always use a helping hand. You will be compensated, and my husband will mentor you."

Nix blushed. Noein, the province of paradisiac beaches and The Great Library of Sanglish, a land without even a Medean garrison... "I cannot, I have unfinished business here," Nix said as she laid her mother’s medallion before the couple. Zhapur yelled interjections after interjections.

"This...How...When..." stammered Zhapur when he grabbed the artifact, his eyes frozen in consternation.

"Claradore told me you possessed the means to open it."

"I would have loved not to disappoint you. This, this medallion. Look at this griffon, it is same as the royal signet’s. It could only have belonged to the fallen Empress of Kings Aishula herself."

"The Empress of Kings?" #emph[How did something relating to her come into Baba’s possession?]

"Are you confident, my love? Coincidences can lead to faulty conclusions," whispered Leila as she rushed to close the door.

"As confident as my detection of fevers, my love. Nix, dispose of it. There must have been an error for all of those who had consorted with the rebellious Aishula have had their head and their descendants’ mounted on a pike by Emperor of Kings nineteen summers ago."

"Why the long face, Phoenix Egg?" hovered Serena around Nix. She juggled a hefty pouch of gold in her hands. Another nobleman had fallen victim to those scheming hands. Seduction and thievery were after a potent combination.

"The medallion," said Nix showing the still locked object.

"You will have to go to Persiphon after all at this rate. Did Zhapur say anything else?"

"Nothing of importance."

#emph[So my head would find its way on a pike if I set foot in Persiphon. The Firstborn could not have honored me better.]

To compensate for this ruinous day, Nix had bought a second eight of those dumplings from the Studion’s merchants. Spartak had already gobbled the first set by his hulking self. Nix and Serena had condemned it to sleep on the cold palace corridor tonight. A cocktail of spices and fried shrimps melted in her tongue while Excubitores chased after hooligans still debating the virtues and merits of their chariot racing teams. Baba had once been an avid supporter of the Rubies. It had seemed her last chariot race had involved a considerable amount of gold that was spoiled on an incompetent rider. In consequence, Nix had been forbidden to spend a single drachma on bets. Such a rule was anathema to the very spirit of Thanatopolis which revolved around the races that Metarexia could no longer host. News from the sport traveled the fastest in The Known World. Even kings from the Barbarian Kingdoms sent presents to their favorite teams.

"Would you like to Persiphon with this ravishing prince? We will find someone who can open this wretched piece," asked Serena.

"They’ll kill you."

"What? Who in Persiphon would trouble tw-one Magi?"

"The Emperor of Kings if Zhapur is to be believed. The man who commands the largest army in the Known World. The man who believes himself to the embodiment of a delirious prophecy."

"The soil belongs to men. The sky belongs to Magi. She who can fly does not need to fear the ground."

"My wings cannot carry you indefinitely."

"We can speak of the little details later."

Serena linked hands with Nix. Her fingers indulged in a myriad of acrobatics around Nix’ own. They explored tendons, phalanges and nerves, each touch playing notes of tenderness on the lute that was Nix’ body. Serena’s thumbs hit octaves of serenity that mellowed any conflicted soul. Through their playful tease, Nix was immersed in the strength of two human beings. The warmth of another could make one forget their vulnerabilities. They had sworn they would face any of the Goddess’ trials in unity.

"What do you say, Phoenix Egg? You can’t live your entire life under the spider’s thrall."

It had never occurred to her that Serena’s lips had never been so close to hers. Nix breathed heavily.

It was likely an illusion. Serena smiled, moving her face away from hers. Bells reverberated through the streets. Zastrian’s Cloister unleashed its own mechanical birds, launching their songs of sorrow and mourning. All citizens had stopped moving as if petrified by a gorgon’s stare. Children tugged at their parents’ tunics clamoring for explanations. Then came the Medean horns from the Palace Complex, the lowest frequency in the Known World. The occasion was evident. The Emperor was dead.
