Something grabbed the child and the soldiers pursued. 
Flavius and Theodore held their torches above their crested helmets.
Their breathing was punctuated by water dripping above. 

The child screamed. It must be a crocodile. Flavius clutched his spear. 
Crocodiles were only native to the province of Noein, but it was not beneath a wealthy patrician to release one in Thanatopolis' sewers.

Flavius waved his torch in the never-ending darkness. Arches decorated with gorgon heads greeted his tired eyes. Emperor Constantius had built the capital's sewers to 
complement the city's aqueduct and possibly to murder those he deemed undesirable. 
Flavius hoped that getting lost would not get him on the list of those Constantius had erased.

"The child must be dead by now. Let us turn back, while we still remember the way we came in," said Theodore.

"We must offer closure to the parents."

"Let the Vigiles take care of the issue. This is no work for Excubitores."

Flavius' shoulders began to feel the weight of his scaled armor and greaves. 
He had worn it for sixteen hours. 

"We must press on," said Flavius.

Water thrashed in front of them. They raised their lances. Crocodiles were 
ambush predators. Knowing them, the beast would first sink beneath the waters
and lunge at them. That was when its teeth would meet scale armor and steel.

Except, nothing came. Flavius and Theodore could not see a single reptilian 
retina glittering in the stream.

"It is afraid. Let us return. It has learned fear," said Theodore.

Theodore screamed. Flavius shed his torch's light behind him. There was a body.
A man ridden with jaundice floated, his face petrified by horror. Blood ran from 
his forehead. Flavius shrieked. Whatever killed the man had crunched the upper part of the skull and emptied its inner contents.

_What kind of beast only feeds on the brain?_ thought Flavius.

Theodore took three steps backward.

"We must leave now!" said Theodore.

Flavius agreed. They ran. The Emperor had to be informed. The entirety of the 
Excurbitores had to be sent down to the sewers to investigate. Perhaps that 
man Claradore would know something. 

Tunnel after tunnel appeared before their eyes. Left turn, right turn, forward. They saw the same arches over and over. Was the entrance always so far? 

"Stop! Stop! This is not the way we came from," said Flavius.

"You mock me! We must keep moving!"

Flavius' hair raised itself. Shivers crawled on his spine. Another corpse. An old woman. The same injury as before. 

"The Goddess be damned! How many are there?" said Flavius.

He should not have asked that question. A third body appeared, this time covered 
in maggots. The smell of death permeated the stagnant air. 

"A creature could not have done this," said Theodore.

"Who else then?"

"A butcher of men..."

"That is good news."

Flavius shot Theodore a dumbfounded look.

"We can bring him to justice and make a name for ourselves, Flavius," continued Theodore.

Flavius imagined the Emperor's reward for bringing such a vile being to court.
They could have statues of them commissioned by the finest artists in the Empire. 
Their pension could double no triple from this deed. Flavius would be able to 
afford a villa from his wife, Drusilla. They would retire from the capital's noise and farm cabbages.

"We shall be rich!" said Flavius.

"A criminal cannot hope to win against two Excubitores," said Theodore.

No man could hope to defeat an Excubitores in single combat. Only the elite 
Elysian Vodrath Ansar and the Rauthengardian Hearthguards could compete with 
the best of the Empire's foot soldiers. 

Theodore went on ahead, vaulting over the corpses. Flavius followed suit. 
It was not his intent to spend a night in this murderer's haven. 

A screeching hiss interrupted their run. Flavius froze, his legs struggling to obey 
his mind. In front of them stood a mockery of a human head attached to a long neck.
The thing extended its seemingly human tongue towards them. 

His grandmother had told him the tale of the Hydra, this being the Magi had created 
for their wars during the Age of Magic. It could not be true. The Age of Magic had 
ended a millennium ago.

"For Emperor Ralens!" bellowed Theodore as he threw his spear at the creature. It caught the projectile with its teeth which now imitated a human sneer. Bloodthirsty 
and intelligent were the two attributes you did not want in a predator.

The Hydra splintered the lance in two. 

Theodore charged, bashing his shield against the head. The monster snarled in pain.

"Come, Flavius!" yelled Theodore.

Hydras had reappeared. To Flavius, the Goddess' teachings were clear: the day the Magi returned signalled the beginning of the end.
The Apocalypse dawned on mankind. He had to tell his wife and children.

"Flavius! Flavius!"

"I am coming! I am coming!"

Flavius turned away from Theodore. His legs carried him away from the duel. 
Behind him, steel collided with teeth. 

Flavius reared his head. Blood seeped from Theodore's upper torso. The Hydra 
picked the Excubitores with its tentacles. Theodore's legs flailed helplessly.
His helmet fell in the bloodied waters. The beast opened its human mouth and bit 
its prey's head.

Flavius screamed. He ran into utter blackness.
