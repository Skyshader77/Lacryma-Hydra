Nix sat in the imperial dining room. She could not take her eyes off the golden-studded round table 
in the middle of a circular banquet room with fretted ceils of ivory.  
Water streamed from below. 
Cogs and wheels sang with the gushing fluid brought from Charov's Aqueduct, 
rotating panels which showered down rose petals. 
Livia breathed lavender, oriental resins and citrus oils sprinkled by pipes.  
_So this is how it feels to be seated in the Sky Terrace. Baba would have been
jealous._

She saw Livia's reflection through the steel fork. Nix had the princess wear a rose dress with an amethyst on the bodice. Her eyes were ringed with mascara. Her lips were carmined, as bright as the Medean phoenix. Her cheeks were daubed with pink powder. All Nix's work on the princess' visage.

Pastries were brought before her hungry eyes. It was impossible for a handmaiden to receive this abundance of sweets. As Livia, however, the finest cooks in the Empire had to deliver the most delectable cakes Nix has ever tasted. 

She deserved it after all. The ingredients for the vial she had deposited in the Faith's well were ordered from apothecaries using Domitian's signet. There was no world in which she would allow the Faith and the Purpleborn to unite against the Red Guild.

She had followed the Purpleborn to their chambers in her feline form. The two simpletons fell asleep unaware, allowing her to slip within Livia's skin. 

Nix snapped her fingers. Lute players began reciting war ballads. 
Bronze balls rumbled from the depths of the imposing structure. 
Water's laminary became turbulence. 
The cogs and wheels sped up. 
She felt herself revolve akin to day and night, 
her rotation unveiling changing ceiling frescoes from the heavens 
to the Gates of Hel.  _Lies...All lies,_ thought Nix. Around her, 
Thanatopolis circled before her very eyes. 
Guards patrolled the floors of the Hippodrome, 
steam was released from the Baths of Karantor and 
masons hung from the four spires of Zastrian's Grand Cloister.

The three storied cake that was brought to her by the handmaidens made her salivate. Blueberries hung on the icing. The scent of pears, apples and oranges flooded her nose. The pastry was shaped akin to a spider. How Claradore managed to track her movements despite embracing his harem and being submerged by bureaucracy was beyond her. 

"Your Highness..." said Serena's voice in the Classical Tongue. The tone was playful and mocking simultaneously.

"Are you not weary?" said Nix with Livia's voice.

"Does Your Highness mean to devour all of that without offering a morsel to her handmaidens?"

"Princesses need to be rewarded from time to time."

"Even for bedding feckless lordlings?"

"Especially for bedding feckless lordlings."

Serena circled the round table. She took up the knife, cutting into the cake. "I knew you favored wearing the raiment of royalty. But this, Your Highness? Some might call it treason."

"Spare me your morals, handmaiden, I am just eating cake."

Serena's laughter rang through the chamber.

"How large a portion does Your Highness require?" asked Serena as she prepared her cut.

"Two thirds," said Nix.

"My, my. You've grown as grasping as any true princess. Mine! Mine! Mine! You are truly Livia in flesh and bones!"

Nix frowned. "I am simply famished."

"Famished for what, Phoenix Wing? Sweetmeats, or another woman's life? Does Claradore know of this? Surely even he must see the danger in your games with the Purpleborn girl's flesh."

"It matters to him not."

"Then he is a fool. You have tasted what it means to live as Purpleborn. Such things take root in the soul. I have watched it happen before. The flavor of power, true power, corrupts all who sup from that cup. You think yourself above it. You are not. And I do not believe you mean to surrender her body, Nix. Not anymore."

"You bore me with philosophy, Serena. I will vacate this body after finishing my cake."
