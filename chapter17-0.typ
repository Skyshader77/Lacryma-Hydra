She had followed the Purpleborn to their chambers in her feline form. The two simpletons fell asleep unaware, allowing her to slip within Domitian's skin. 

A fortnight ago, Livia had been the subject of her experiments. But a question lingered in her mind: how was life as a man? 

She ordered Domitian's eyes open. His body bolted out of the bed, tugging 
the bed sheet. Livia groaned in protest.

The first thing that Nix noticed were her bulkier legs. In fact, every gesture and step she made displaced more mass. The abundance of hair 
was also noteworthy. She pulled one strand of hair, contemplating its thickness. Her flesh was also much warmer than a woman's body.
_Intriguing,_ thought Nix.

She cleared her throat.

"I am Domitian the Dumb. I hide behind Ordogan in the battlefield and steal his glory. I tell the Emperor that I am the bravest of all men. I am only Magister Militum because my fiance is the princess. Rawr! " she said with Domitian's baritone voice. The tone made her guffaw.

She flexed his muscles in front of the vanity mirror in the same manner as Claradore's, imaging Domitian perform the gesture in front of Elysian armies.
All she got in return was a lump of flesh masquerading as a biceps. It was risible. Her laughter rang through the room. Livia rolled in the bed in frustration.
The beard. How men managed to eat without having breadcrumbs infiltrate their facial hair was beyond her. Nix stroked Domitian's beard. She admitted that it was well maintained yet she could not help but believe that Domitian let his facial hair grow only because people commented on his childish visage.

_What else is there to do as a man?_ thought Nix.

She must lift a heavy object. Settling for the desk containing Livia's arsenal,
Nix put Domitian's arms to good use. She ordered his arms under the desk. Veins bulged. She grunted. Again and again. Domitian's arms ached. The desk did not move an inch. How disappointing. Nix should not be surprised. Disappointment characterized Domitian's life.

"Fear me, foul Elysians, for my non-existent muscles will terrorize you!" said Nix. She heard the bed sheets rustle.

"What in the Goddess' name are you doing, my sunshine?" said Livia.

Nix returned a blank stare. There was only one way to save herself from this situation.

"I needed to use the latrines," said Nix with Domitian's voice.

"Be quick! Return to sleep! We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow," said Livia before burying her head under the covers.

Ever since she had seen how easy it was for people such as Claradore to urinate in the woods, she could not help but wonder. Nix headed for the latrines, discarding Domitian's trousers.

To her surprise, Domitian's phallus was notably smaller than Claradore or Majorian's. How Livia could find delight in this was an absolute riddle.

_How do I do this?_ thought Nix. A stream of urine was released from Domitian's penis. The fluid went everywhere but inside the hole. Some even leaked on her leg. It was only that Nix realized that men were supposed to aim. Nix swore with Domitian's voice.

"Silence!" screeched Livia's voice in the room.

As much as Domitian's form intrigued her, Nix assessed that it lacked warmth. Her center of gravity had been displaced. Every movement required an adaptation. 
Every step she took was a struggle to maintain her balance. Nix tried stretching her back forwards. With her own body, she could easily reach her toes with her fingers. As Domitian, a searing sensation consumed her back when she tried to do the same. It seemed as if Domitian's spinal chord would explode if she attempted to touch the floor.

There were more practical questions. How would she wield a lance and a shield? There was no hiding in the shadows when one became a Magister Militum. One was expected to lead the men on the battlefield in order to be rewarded with nude marble statues of themselves in the streets of the imperial capital. At least that was how the Sarvitarians viewed the generals of old.

Then there was the option of wearing the actual Emperor's body. What was the advantage of being an Emperor over an Empress? The Sarvitarian and Medean Empires forbade women from sitting alone on the throne ever since Empress Zenobia sacked the Holy City of Mizrakenaz and stuffed High Cardinal Pius' genitals in his mouth. The Empire required an emperor. The Senate had codified this absurd requirement. It was utmost ingratitude towards the service of the brave women who helped edify this empire.

In practice, empresses possessed a similar level of agency as their male counterparts. Nix remembered how the Empress Lupicina held sway over Ralens the Elder before her exile. No decision was taken without her consent. Thanatopolis also remembered that it was Empress Alianne who saved the city from the Molochian hordes by mobilizing thousands of citizens to repair in the fortifications in the wake of the largest earthquake. Yet it was her consort Emperor Charov whom they built marble statues and for whose honor they dedicated libraries to.

But the unenviable downsides were evident. The wide majority of Sarvitarian Emperors met a violent death. Nix would probably not fancy looking behind her shoulder at every turn for hidden blades, nor would she risk being tortured by mutinous soldiers. Empresses at least faced the dignity of exile in a convent. Such was the benefits of being the shadow behind the throne. 

She understood why Claradore relinquished the crown at Ralens the Elder's funeral.
Being the public face of discontent was a far too risky endeavor. Should the court or the populace's anger reach riotous proportions, Claradore could always put his eggs in another basket while the current Emperor be thrown to the wolves of public disapproval. Of course, the Red Guild disliked risk. The role of the Empress provided the perfect balance between safety and dominion over the Medean Empire.

Furthermore, the court did not gaze nor swoon at Domitian the same way as they did for Livia. Rarely did anyone fawn over Domitian's unimpressive physique until his engagement with Livia. This was insufficient for Nix. The mark of success was having the entire court ogle you with green faces. Being a Purpleborn meant that everyone wanted to trade places with you.

Nix glanced at Livia on the bed. The princess snored. Nix could not make a man's body wear Livia's crimson and onyx dress. Armor conveyed fear and intimidation, but purple dresses exuded beauty and prestige. Why be a man when you can make them do your bidding through a crown? The decision was thus simple.

She made Domitian's body rejoin his lover in bed. His lips met with Livia's.
Nix felt herself enter Livia's mouth.

Two hours later, Nix sat in the imperial dining room. She could not take her eyes off the golden-studded round table 
in the middle of a circular banquet room with fretted ceils of ivory.  
Water streamed from below. 
Cogs and wheels sang with the gushing fluid brought from Charov's Aqueduct, 
rotating panels which showered down rose petals. 
Livia breathed lavender, oriental resins and citrus oils sprinkled by pipes.  
_So this is how it feels to be seated in the Sky Terrace. Baba would have been
jealous._

She saw Livia's reflection through the steel fork. Nix had the princess wear a rose dress with an amethyst on the bodice. Her eyes were ringed with mascara. Her lips were carmined, as bright as the Medean phoenix. Her cheeks were daubed with pink powder. All Nix's work on the princess' visage.

Pastries were brought before her hungry eyes. It was impossible for a handmaiden to receive this abundance of sweets. As Livia, however, the finest cooks in the Empire had to deliver the most delectable cakes Nix has ever tasted. 

She deserved it after all. The ingredients for the vial she had deposited in the Faith's well were ordered from apothecaries using Domitian's signet. There was no world in which she would allow the Faith and the Purpleborn to unite against the Red Guild.

Nix snapped her fingers. Lute players began reciting war ballads. 
Bronze balls rumbled from the depths of the imposing structure. 
Water's laminary became turbulence. 
The cogs and wheels sped up. 
She felt herself revolve akin to day and night, 
her rotation unveiling changing ceiling frescoes from the heavens 
to the Gates of Hel.  _Lies...All lies,_ thought Nix. Around her, 
Thanatopolis circled before her very eyes. 
Guards patrolled the floors of the Hippodrome, 
steam was released from the Baths of Karantor and 
masons hung from the four spires of Zastrian's Grand Cloister.

The three storied cake that was brought to her by the handmaidens made her salivate. Blueberries hung on the icing. The scent of pears, apples and oranges flooded her nose. The pastry was shaped akin to a spider. How Claradore managed to track her movements despite embracing his harem and being submerged by bureaucracy was beyond her. 

"Your Highness..." said Serena's voice in the Classical Tongue. The tone was playful and mocking simultaneously.

"Are you not weary?" said Nix with Livia's voice.

"Does Your Highness mean to devour all of that without offering a morsel to her handmaidens?"

"Princesses need to be rewarded from time to time."

"Even for bedding feckless lordlings?"

"Especially for bedding feckless lordlings."

Serena circled the round table. She took up the knife, cutting into the cake. "I knew you favored wearing the raiment of royalty. But this, Your Highness? Some might call it treason."

"Spare me your morals, handmaiden, I am just eating cake."

Serena's laughter rang through the chamber.

"How large a portion does Your Highness require?" asked Serena as she prepared her cut.

"Two thirds," said Nix.

"My, my. You've grown as grasping as any true princess. Mine! Mine! Mine! You are truly Livia in flesh and bones!"

Nix frowned. "I am simply famished."

"Famished for what, Phoenix Wing? Sweetmeats, or another woman's life? Does Claradore know of this? Surely even he must see the danger in your games with the Purpleborn girl's flesh."

"It matters to him not."

"Then he is a fool. You have tasted what it means to live as Purpleborn. Such things take root in the soul. I have watched it happen before. The flavor of power, true power, corrupts all who sup from that cup. You think yourself above it. You are not. And I do not believe you mean to surrender her body, Nix. Not anymore."

"You bore me with philosophy, Serena. I will vacate this body after finishing my cake."

"You are an execrable liar, your Highness. You have been thinking on it, have you not?"

Nix rolled Livia's eyes.

"What do you accuse me of? I have done nothing!"

"How will you wield this borrowed flesh? To issue commands you would never have given in your own skin? To deceive your betrothed in his bed? Do you comprehend what it will be like when she wakes with no memory of what her body has done? The horror of being made a puppet in one's own skin? I would not wish such a fate upon my bitterest enemy. There is a reason the Magi made this sorcery punishable by death. The theft of one's very self was deemed the vilest of all transgressions."

"You worry too much. I am quite the honorable person."

"Let us pray that is so, Your August Majesty."

Serena vacated the dining room, allow Nix to savor the pastries arrayed before her. She found solace in having cranberries and sugary flour touch her borrowed tongue. It was never fair. The Purpleborn could eat as many treats as they desired. They could win the hearts of any lover they set their eyes on.

What was her friend thinking? Surely Serena did not find it believable that Nix would fornicate with Domitian of all people with Livia's body. The brutish man was as revolting as a plague rat. Ordogan or Majorian on the other hand...No, that question was not meant to be answered tonight.
