In normal circumstances, diving head first into a well without a plan was considered 
suicide. The great Sarvitar's ghost would be rolling in his sarcophagus. But Nix 
was a Magi, not a soldier, a very careless Magi. 

She landed on turpid water. Spartak fell atop her back. Water splashed on her face. 
Nix groaned in pain. 

She flicked her fingers, birthing a flame in her palms. Corridors of arches adorned with gorgon heads unfolded before her eyes. Emperor Marro built these sewers from the back of thousand of slaves who were executed after the complex' completion. Now only 
the Goddess had the full layout of this labyrinth.

The octopus that had taken Ralens and Majorian must not be far. Nothing made sense.
Octopi were sea borne creatures. While there existed specimens which were as large as 
a quinquereme, these were confined to the ocean's abyss. Nix has never heard of a land borne cephalopod. 

"Where are they, Spartak," she said to her dog.

The hound sniffed the stagnant air. It moved upstream. She followed it.
The man Emperor Ralens the Elder had executed a few months ago had ventured inside 
this complex only to claim monsters inhabited it. 

_Maybe we had misjudged him_ thought Nix. It was too late for empathy. The Emperor could never be seen making a mistake for his will was absolute. The day the purple born admitted any error would be the end of their holy mandate.

Nix was unfazed by the first headless corpse Spartak found. It belonged to an old man who wore one of the Emeralds' armlet. Rats and maggots feasted on the remains. Spartak barked with apprehension. There would be more. There was no story of octopi preying 
on humans on land. A corridor led to a dead end. A mountain of putrefying corpses 
laid before her eyes. Boys, girls, old and young were piled up for roaches and other agents of the Gatekeeper to devour. All of the dead were missing their head. No creature in the Known World 
only feasted on the head.

They found Majorian's unconscious body. She checked his heartbeat. 

_He is alive,_ thought Nix. She planted a kiss on his forehead.

Her arms hauled Majorian and his heavy armor. There was now the issue of finding the Emperor and returning both of them to the surface with her frail arms. Unless 
of course Spartak did not mind carrying both of them when the time came. 

"I will make your favorite treat for an entire month," said Nix. Spartak simply wagged 
its tail.

Something slithered in the water behind her. It tried to practice this pretend 
stealth. Fool! A Magi was not an easy prey. Spartak growled at the newcomer. 
Nix heard a tentacle jump out of the water, lunging at her. She closed her eyes. 
Her right arm melted. _Sword,_ she thought. Blood filaments formed a blade. 
She slashed, feeling blood slice both air and flesh. The creature's appendage fell in shallow water.

"Maaa-aaaa-aaa-g-iii-iiii-iiii," hissed an inhuman voice hailing from the other side of the Gates of the Underworld.

"It talks! It talks?" screamed Nix. Her blood froze. Chills cascaded down her bones. 
This was no octopus. No, no, no, the ability of speech or rather the proof of intelligence made this monster a dangerous one. Only creatures created by Magi were capable of speech. Claradore had to know. Or did he?
The man was buried by endless layers of Medean bureaucracy. He could not have the time 
for a promenade through the sewers. And what if this thing was his pet? 

_He would have told me,_ thought Nix.

"IIII waaaaant youuuuuuu, Maaa-aaaa-aaa-g-iii-iiii-iiii," taunted the thing in 
what appeared to the Forgotten Tongue.

"Show your ugly visage first," said Nix.

Perhaps some taunts were best left unsaid. Not one but eight heads emerged from the 
darkness. All were parodies of human faces deformed by misuse of magic. Some faces 
grinned, others performed this despicable imitation of human sorrow. Baba had told her the stories of the Hydra, this beast that hid beneath villages and fed on unsuspecting villagers. The Magi had tamed these creatures, using them to cull their 
slave armies. The history books said that all were destroyed by the Goddess alongside their Magi masters. Visibly, the history books were erroneous again.

"Maaa-aaaa-aaa-g-iii-iiii-iiii, feeeeeeed meeeeeeeee."

The thing reeked of death and of dark magic. 
Ending her days within its stomach was not a desirable outcome. Nix concentrated her blood on her left arm. Another blood blade was formed. The Magi had created the Hydras.
This rogue beast needed to be reminded who its masters were. Once it was tamed, the 
possibility of harnessing its power for the Red Guild was all too tempting. Claradore 
could send it to Metarexia where it could have a buffet beneath the Octine Cathedral. 

It attacked first, sending one of its vile heads forward. It bore its fangs which were as sharp as a shark's. 
With only one head, its motions were predictable. The tempo was too slow. She could waltz around it indefinitely. Her blood blade 
cleaved the head in half. The second head came next. Sending them one by one? The Hydra was only as smart as the most uncultured human. She felt her hand slice through its
cartilage. Its blood tasted foul unlike a human's. 
The heads fell in the waters.

"So you understand the Forgotten Tongue. Release the Emperor at once and your life 
will be spared," said Nix.

The Hydra made a parody of a laugh.

The stumps that became the heads 
retreated. Blood and bones bulged from the injuries. All made a horrible gurgling sound. To her horror, flesh arose from the decapitated sections. It blossomed akin to a fetid flower. Four new 
heads emerged. All made detestable grimaces.

Nix did not fancy this. The monster had acquired some sort of confidence. According to Baba's encyclopedias, Hydras preferred to ambush their prey. The sole reason why this one would face its food source head on was that it had learned not to fear humanity anymore. 

_I have to do everything myself,_ thought Nix.

Nix whistled. Spartak joined the melee, gnawing at one head. The Hydra wailed, sending her dog 
flying in the air before smashing it down with a tentacle. She tried to reach 
Spartak. A wall of hideous heads obstructed her. Nix kept on slashing. Something 
bit her leg. She screamed. One of the Hydra's visages crunched her heel, lifting 
her up in the air. Her arms flailed in the air.

"Nooooooooot scaaaaaaaaaaaaryyyyyyyyyy," taunted the thing. One of its heads opened its gaping mouth.

She liquefied her leg, freeing herself from its grip. A grimy substance followed her blood. Venom. It had entered her body.
Nix spun around herself, her blood swords forming a wheel of serrating blades. 
She threw herself against the thing, pressing her arms against its swarm of heads.
Tentacles, appendages and heads were propelled in the air. The creature roared in pain.

_At least it knows pain,_ thought Nix.

"Who birthed you?" asked Nix.

"Gooooooooooooooo...Goooooooooooooooooooooood" hissed the thing.

The assault had to continue. She had the initiative and any tactician agreed that losing it was a mistake. Blood splattered on her face. Her blood blades tore through bones and flesh alike. Nix was the heavy calvary that plowed through a disorganized 
phalanx, a hot sword carving a bloody path through cheese. She lost count of the number of heads she had cut of. Was it ten? Twenty? How many 
did this creature possess? The books only mentioned Hydras with 5-6 heads. This one had more than thrice that number.

Nix continued her charge. The enemy shield wall had reached its breaking point. She could feel it. By the time she had cut down the forest of heads, she would reach the 
sleeping princess' castle. There lied the Hydra's heart. Like a charming prince, Nix 
would claim her prize and add the trophy to her gallery.

A searing pain in her abdomen stopped her carnage. Nix fell, clutching her stomach.
A mixture of green and black fluids 
glowed in her veins. Her right leg grew numb. Her vision fluttered. 
The poison. Within hours no minutes, she would not be able to run anymore. Claradore would know what to do. He had an antidote.

Spartak shielded her front. A head came at her only for her dog to headbutt it.
The head winced in agony, one of its eyeballs dangling on Spartak's jaws.

Nix mustered every droplet of strength she could find to stand up. Her breathing had slowed even though her life now depended on it. In front of her, more heads sprouted from the thing's severed organs. 

She tried reforging a blood blade. Her arm refused her command. The blood filaments 
failed to converge. Nix cursed. To lose because of attrition to an animal of all things. 

The innumerable heads stared at both her and Spartak. They gloated with their satire of a smile. It was a futile endeavor. She looked behind her. A dead end greeted her.

Nix needed fire. A lot of it. To her knowledge, a Hydra of this size must have at least eighty heads. A conservative estimate would be that its body took up the 
entirety of the sewers. Not even a legion could dislodge it.
