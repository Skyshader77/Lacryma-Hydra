"Do you have candy?" asked the boy who must have been twelve summers at most.

Serena handed him the treat. The boy and two other accomplices had snuck into the dromon which prow she sat on. The dockyards overflowed with these unfinished warships. Claradore’s new decree had doubled the expenditures for the Medean army.

Today was supposed to be Nix’ birthday, yet Serena’s friend had been preoccupied by trivial matters, leaving Serena alone to throw rocks at the North Sea on this moonless evening. When Nix joined her, they would indulge in this contest to determine who would cook dinner for the night. Yesterday, Nix had decided to not conform to the rules, transforming her hand into this slingshot that could launch pebbles up to one imperial mile away.

"Didn’t you agree not to use magic for this, Phoenix Wing?"

"It is not magic, it is a special alteration of my arm."

"Who are you now? A professor of the Classical Tongue? Magic is magic."

"I am who I desire to be," said Nix. In response, Serena had pulled Nix’ cheeks with such force that Nix might have liquified on the spot. Once they had resolved their discussion on terminology, Nix had begrudgingly roasted the mutton Claradore had hunted for them, resulting in skewers with orange peppers and olives. Serena had to celebrate these victories while they were still easy to come. The day has yet to come.

The sound of water splashing made her turn her head towards someone whose hands were thrashing in the North Sea. The boy. His gremlin friends yelped. Predictable. The older she became, the more she noticed the predictability children’s of personalities no matter the age. As watching over humans was identical to gardening, some children’s defining traits fell into mosses, others into ferns, flowering plants or non-flowering plants. Then, by observing their inner nature, they could fall into one of the multiple species Serena had cultivated. Never had Serena failed to associate a child by its plant. Surprise was missing from her long existence. That was until Nix and Claradore had come.

The boy in the North Sea strayed further and further away from Serena’s vision. One of his fellow accomplices kept his finger on his friend’s location while the other yelled in the deserted dockyards.

"Goddess! Goddess! Help him!" screamed the gremlin. Serena stood up on the dromon’s prow. She felt her blood converge towards her back. Perhaps she would feel generous today.

Children of all ages would always underestimate the current. One wrong move in the sea, and it would devour you as it did with the Sunken Continent. Another case of parental failure and of the child not heeding his parents’ advice.

With her wings she could have done it. The two accomplices who had followed the boy screamed frantically, hoping an Excubitore or a heroic passerby would undo this preventable tragedy. Alas, life was never a fairy tale and this was what rendered life the most gorgeous and the most monotonous creation the Forgotten Gods had ever bestowed on this world. Better a lesson learned through blood than to receive a token of ingratitude.

When all that remained was the sea’ murderous calmness, the two accomplices sobbed the same way Nix had when she had lost the Nameless Slave. Serena yawned.

Was it all a mistake? What was done could never be undone. Serena had resented herself for overestimating men. They would use the Goddess’ name to hide behind their evil. They would babble about the Gospel to tame the masses the Goddess had freed. They would abhor change in the name of idiotic traditions. They could ignite wars without magic. For the Goddess became the magic of the Age of Man. Yet with magic, men could fly. Men could see the sun while resting their necks on clouds. Who had never wished they could fall asleep on a nimbus, their misty surface being the perfect bed. With magic, water could be solidified when touched by one’s blood allowing men run on water, feeling their feet bounce on the surface of lakes and seas. Nix and Claradore had reminded Serena of how much the Goddess had taken away from the world.

#emph[I have been a fool, haven’t I, Erfan?]

"We were all fools," had said the Nameless Slave nineteen summers ago in her house built atop mushrooms. Serena had never thought she had it in her, to retire to a secluded location away from men who now waged war on themselves without magic.

"Better fools than helots," had answered Serena in the Forgotten Tongue. She had been invited to savor one of the Nameless Slave’ new recipes involving a catfish roasted with ginger, thymes and black pepper.

"Are we not still helots? Trapped in this prison of immortality that you have built for both of us."

"You can always fall on your sword, Slave."

"The Nameless Slave might have done so, but she no longer exists. I have been known as Baba for three centuries now."

"Baba? How intriguing. Is that it will address you, this Magi that you are hiding from me? What is its name?"

"Nix," said the Nameless Slave, her voice cracked, her face whitening under the pressure of Serena’s words. The Nameless Slave has grown attached to a Magi. Absurd. Change had not been a feature of their design. Nix. That name. Why had that name been chosen? The newborn Magi was unaware that her life had already been decided when she had first crossed Serena’s path.

"Bring her to me,"

"Will I have to build a small coffin if I do?"

"A command is a command, Slave."

Serena had surprised herself by leaving the house with clean hands. Growing senile had made her teeter towards irrationality.

The night before, Nix had sought her medallion which had mysteriously disappeared. From the ground below, Serena had the honor of witnessing the finesse of Nix’ flight. Moonlight had shimmered on the girl’s crimson wings as they flapped under the starry night. An astray phoenix she was looking for a nest she never had, a flock long extinct. If Nix had known the truth, would she blame Serena? No, she would understand. Serena had no choice. The Gatekeeper had created Nix in the image of that woman, one whose legs had enlaced with Serena’s, one whose lush lips tasted like wine, one whose eyes burned with resentment on that terrible day.

Serena had put the coruscating lance she had found for Nix’ birthday on the bed.

"Happy birthday, Phoenix Wing," she whispered quietly to the empty bed.

Nix’ encyclopedias and archives could never do the weapon justice for it was Regnant the Dragonslayer’s weapon, the same he had used to slay the Last Dragon. Serena would tell Nix that it was an eerily accurate replica, her friend being none the wiser. Acquiring it had required Serena to fly through a phantasmagoria of nostalgia and sorrow for Serena’s white wings had carried her to the lands of crags and sequoias. Now known as part of the Unknown world for the present civilizations, this nature preserve used to teem with fallen kingdoms. During her second childhood with Nix, they had spoken about the tales never told in the past. Tales they were not to Serena. Her blood and tears had forged the words the scribes had scrambled to write on parchments as they had followed her trail of glory. The Nameless Slave had been there, chronicling each deed and so-called miracle before Serena had made the mistake of emancipating her.

Dragon bones and skulls littered the forest that had once been razed by their fire, their carrion breath lingering in Serena’s nose for years. The Magi could breed these flying creatures whose wingspan shrouded hills and mountains. Armies had melted under their might, unable to pierce their hardened scale. Serena had witnessed the day the non-Magi turned the tides against their Magi overlords. With the power of her betrayal, they had disintegrated the mightiest of dragons with lightning bolts the Goddess had conjured. Such was the elation her, the Goddess and her men had felt when it had finally been accomplished, when man had been freed from magic, when the Age of Man had begun under the Goddess’ name.

The Nameless Slave’s question about the tiny coffin had lingered in Serena’s mind for the past eight years. Centuries ago, that question would have been valid. The first Magi born in a millennium. Somehow, Serena found herself envious. It was true. Life without Magi had worn her.
