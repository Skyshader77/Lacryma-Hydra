Majorian emerged from the darkness. She did not expect it to return after their last argument. But logic dictated otherwise. Where else would Majorian go? Sextus was no friend of theirs, and they would be lynched at any human settlement.

"My last words to you were hasty," said Majorian in the Classical Tongue. It chose a female voice for this first sentence.

"Enlighten me," said Livia.

Majorian had proven to be as unpredictable as storm winds. They were also aware of her secret. Perhaps it would be appropriate to keep them close to one's self.

"You have only done what you did out of self-preservation," said Majorian.

_He now sings my song. What has changed?_ thought Livia.

"You accused me of being a liar. Does that statement still hold" She clicked her tongue. "My love," she said with Nix's voice.

"Nix! Nix!" said Majorian with such enthusiasm. It might have brought her comfort in her old self.

Majorian opened their arms. Livia flung herself into their embrace. The creature's body was frigid as a winter mistral. What happened to this tenderness that once characterized every one of their embraces? She once swore she could feel at home in its arms. It once could convince her that it would shield her from all of their enemies. Now, she felt constrained in this prison of monstrous flesh. Its heartbeat beat at a deviant rhythm. To it, she was neither a friend nor foe. What then?

It must have sensed her discomfort as it made a sly smile. She returned the gesture.

"May I ask for a kiss?" they asked.

Panic cascaded through Livia's spine. Her lips meeting their? This could only happen in the most erotic of stories from the Regnassian Empires where the authors fantasized about satyrs mating with humans. She buried her face in its torso, wincing in disgust.

They put their hands around her waist. She shivered. Their claws would tear the fabric of the rose gown the hand maiden had worked day and night to maintain. Majorian's carrion breath was too much. Its skin was rugged like a shark's. It grated against her bare skin.

"Stop," Livia whispered.

The look on its face could have wounded her as Nix. _I must be hallucinating,_ thought Livia. Emotions were impossible for Magrub Dogas.

"Ni...Livia, how long I have missed you. Please..." croaked Majorian.

"You yearn for the past, Majorian. There is no returning to it as you know too well. I have become an empress."

"What are you saying, Nix? You have only borrowed her form. Once Sextus is defeated, you will return to being Nix."

Livia was unsure. Her current life was undeniably superior to that of a handmaiden. It was plain to see.

"I have kissed Ordogan," Livia said plainly.

Blunt and serrated just like she had hoped. The message would come across. 
Majorian recoiled. Its monstrous face made a parody of a grimace. 

"I have nothing to deserve this, my love," said Majorian.

"You have perished long ago. I have done my mourning. Widows are not bound to their dead man. I am only acting in accordance with that simple fact. An empress' decisions are not to be questioned."

"How can you be so cruel?"

"A monster lecturing me on cruelty? What has this world come to?"

Majorian seized her arm.

"Nix, you must leave with me at once!" declared Majorian. The confidence in its voice was disconcerting.

"What threat do you see?"

"You have once told me our story relates to the Beauty and the Monster. I am well aware that that story ends with the Beauty slaying the Monster. I do not wish for either of us to live through that fate."

_Perhaps that is an appropriate ending to this story,_ thought Livia.

The creature's last words have convinced that there was no longer any shred of humanity left within the Magrud Doga. It now listened to the whispers of whatever master puppeteered its body. She had failed to access its allegiances. It had become a dynamic variable in this already complicated equation. Her dominant arm clung to her hidden dagger. 

"Ironic isn't it? How we became the embodiment of this song? You the Monster and I the Beauty," said Livia. She watched his neckline. The jugular should lay exposed at any moment.

"Come with me to the Unknown World as you promised before all of this. Maybe...Maybe there will be civilization more accepting of my condition," said Majorian.

"Humans are a constant throughout the world. There will be zealots and violence regardless on which continent we travel to."

She saw tears rolling from their amber eyes.

"Then, what do you suggest, my love?"

Its jugular was finally visible. The veins flowed brightly. One stroke and it would be all over. Only Claradore would be aware of her secret.

A howl pealed through their conversation. Livia released her hold over her hidden dagger. She swore quietly. Livia and Majorian left the hedgerow.
She covered her mouth. Two Ralens stood before her, one made of blood, the other made of flesh and bones.
