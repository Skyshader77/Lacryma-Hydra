The sky bled above the land of crags and sequoias. Dragons melted in the air, their hardened wings incinerated by the Goddess’ lightning bolts. The sound of her fingers cracking as they produced those nightmarish projectiles, the cries of the beasts crashing down from the firmament with their wailing riders, the roaring flames eating away at the World Tree. All would haunt him for the rest of his life. In a matter of months, the non Magi had found the confidence to challenge dragons with the strength of betrayal. The Regnassian armies shook the ground. A horde it was, uprooting forests, drying out lakes and riverbeds. The Sunken Continent had ceased to exist. It took a full year to receive the news. From the battlements of the Secret Village of the Clarans, Dorian watched the dove banners slowly approach the final bastion of sorcery. He had gotten sick of the smell of dragonfire and blood sorcery.

His mother and father mounted The Last Dragon. Dorian’s ten year old face saw itself in their dragonscale armor.

"She calleth herself the Goddess now," said his father.

"The Goddess, sayest thou? The Children of the Sky wouldst be rolling in their Ark. What cometh next? Did she slay the Creator with her own hand?" said his mother.

"Mother, Father, go not," said Dorian.

Dorian’s father stroked Dorian’s hair with his glove. The other hand carried the last tarantula banner, the largest one the village had ever produced. Dorian had helped sew it. He had hoped the Faith’s armies would be terrorized by it. A foolish thought and he knew it. "Dorian, one day shalt thou understand the choice we maketh this day. Thou hast thine orders. Go to the Tree of Life. Thy apprenticeship shall end upon our return."

His apprenticeship...Dorian had yet to master any spell contained in the Grimoire of Red. A boring book. He had wanted to become an artist not a battle mage. Magic and its intricacies should be left to the other Magi.

"I...Choice...Heum...Hmmm...Hmmm..." said Dorian from whom strings were attached to his wooden teeth. Behind him, a background proudly colored by orphans depicted the apocalyptic scene Claradore had told Nix about many times. Her thoughts went on about the sun, an orange ball with eight straight lines protruding from its circumference. Nix groaned causing Dorian to flail in the miniature stage.

#emph[I forgot my line.]

The Dorian puppet in her left hand levitated in the air awkwardly. Its strings entangled themselves with the Last Dragon’s. Nix cursed. She had only applied one layer of varnish on both puppets. To her spectators, it would have seemed that Dorian kissed his mother’s doll in an execrable rendition of Claradore’s story. Prince Ralens the Younger clapped. Nix smiled back at him, her unwavering supporter or was it actually because she had baked him Baba’s cookies this morning?

Nix scanned her audience. Silk garnments, tunics embroidered with golden phoenixes, stolas on which were pinned octagonal jewels lit by the four braziers in the stands. Only now did it occur to her that the red tunic she had been so proud to sew might be inadequate for the occasion. Some members of the audience had the gall of eating those lobster and shrimp dumplings she had grown fond of. The smell of those. She had hoped no one saw her saliva drip on the stone floor. Torture. Pure torture. She would personally petition the Emperor for that to be considered torture.

The decent spectators had been her loyal customers: the marble statues of Emperors Vitiatus, Charov and of Empress Zenobia the Liberator which flanked the seats. As a child, she would imagine them assisting her plays from the afterlife, smiling at her poor retelling of their brave exploits.

Ralens the Younger’s elder sister, Livia, had fallen asleep over an hour ago next to her brother. Nix’ eyes twitched seeing Livia’s purple silk dress, one that costed twenty times as much as her annual salary. Why was she not allowed to own such vestments more beautiful as the tunics Baba had once knit for her? #emph[I am the one who had to fetch that gold cloak you are wearing right now!] To add insult to injury, the crown. The crown. The Goddess damned crown sitting on the sleeping princess’ head. Gold molded into the shape of a phoenix stared right back at Nix, calling her, taunting her, laughing at her. Never had an inanimate object been so irresistible to her. What was it about that item? Was it that it reminded of something she could put her fingers on? Nix did not know. Being in Livia’s presence was a constant reminder of her own insignificance.

#emph[It would look better on me.]

Emperor Ralens the Elder merely blinked. Impassible, unreadable. The face of a sphinx presenting an unsolvable riddle. He had always been impressive to her. Like her, the Medean Emperors were taught to camouflage their true emotions behind a mask, one that Claradore had forced her to study. Like her, they had to perform before an audience, an entire country, wearing elaborate costumes, most of which being impractical for the common of men. Yet, unlike her, they did not possess the luxury of taking off their mask once the curtains fell.

"A ruler has officially two faces for the realm: a public one, a mask for the Known World to behold, the second, a private one for close friends and the women he beds. Yet there exists a third one, one whose existence is only known to the emperor himself and glimpsed only in the reflection of the mirror’s gaze. Once that mask was uncovered, a ruler’s weakness was revealed and the weak... The weak get beaten," Claradore had taught her.

Ralens the Younger continued to applaud. The palace’s amphitheater followed him. Silver coins were thrown at the stage. Nix blushed, bowing before her spectators. She could get used to it, the adulation. After all, politics and drama branched out from the same root, both characterized by an emphasis on performance and grandiose eccentricities. Intentions were disguised through contrived words and gestures. In a way, the imperial court was an amphitheater itself.

"The play is not over yet, my Prince," said Claradore when Nix began putting back the puppets in their box. He emerged behind the stage, his presence causing the noblewomen and noblemen alike to throw every bouquet they had at him. In fact, Nix was sure people only attended the play because of Claradore.

"I’ve never heard this story before. It must have taken quite the imagination to create something with what little the archives could provide," said Ralens the Elder.

"Trust me, your August Majesty, fiction is not my greatest strength. In the desert of history, many stories have been swallowed by the sands of time. It is but the duty of the informed to share that knowledge with those whose time is but a primordial commodity," said Claradore.

"This book from which you extract your stories..."

#emph[The Grimoire of Red. Do you really want to read it? You would lose your sleep if you knew.] The Known World was not ready. None was ready. Not even Baba could have predicted its contents. At long last, Nix understood why Baba and Claradore drifted apart. Baba, in her isolated shack, never understood the potential the book offered to a Magi.

"Written in the Forgotten Tongue, your August Majesty. Our translators are working day and night to bring a copy to your desk," said Claradore. #emph[Clever liar.]

"Can we have another story, Father? Pretty please?" said Ralens the Younger with the eyes of a younger Spartak. With those pupils briming of innocence, he could ask Nix to do anything for him.

Ralens the Elder looked at his daughter. Nix had overheard his conversations on the marriage he was arranging. She had yet to relay this information to Claradore. A mistake or rather an inconvenience due to her ejecting herself from a cat’s body. "Your sister seems to disagree. She needs to rest," said the Emperor.

"B-b-but, my Scholae Palatinae can carry her to her bedroom. I want to stay! You said yourself you never heard this story! We never hear stories from the Age of Magic!"

"That is an order, Prince of the Medeans!"

"I too must beg your leave for tonight, your Eminence. We are hosting a soup kitchen at the Grand Cloister in a few hours," said Claradore, bowing before his liege.

"Can I come too?" said Ralens the Younger. Nix stopped disassembling the puppet stage. She noticed the nicks and gouges on some of the puppets she had hand painted, cursing silently. Another dent in her budget she would have to take. One of her hands reached for a hidden object beneath her tunic only to return with nothing. #emph[I did not bring my knife.] Escort duty was not on her list.

"No, your polo instructor will be at your door before the rooster calls. Your punctuality is to be impeccable from now on as we agreed," said Ralens the Elder. Nix caught a whiff of his cologne, this gargantuan scent sinking its teeth into her nose before ripping it wide open. It reminded her smoked and charred wood, hinting a premonition of rebirth. Similar to the Medean Empress’ perfume, this scent could only be worn by a single man in the entire empire. Nix saw the bottle countless times in the imperial wardrobe, barely restraining her hands to open it every time.

"But the Master of Herbs said that a good ruler must be able to sympathize with the commonfolk. How can I do that if I am always in the palace?" His hand pointed to Nix. "Nix here even said she would give me a tour of the Studion if I taught her how to ride a horse."

#emph[You goof! You were not supposed to say that to the Emperor himself!]

"There is a time and place for everything, my Prince. You have long life ahead of you unlike many of us. It would be wise to savor the little moments. Most of us can only dream of getting access to polo lessons," said Claradore.

Nix threw the minced broccoli into the mélange. A sublime mix of coriander and pepper entered her nose. Her stomach rumbled. Taking a sip, she let peas and chicken powder flow over her tongue. Waves of elation rushed through her taste buds. #emph[Delicious. But not salty enough.] This had once been one of Baba’s recipes. Like with everything he touched, Claradore had vastly enhanced it.

Above Zastrian’s Grand Cloister, frescoes that still showed the Tiarmat hydra devouring the sun unwinded on the ceiling. Ruby rosettes decorated indentations that had been cut in the domed roof by Sarvitarian engineers. Each quadrant of the rotunda was home to one of Nix and Claradore’s favorite emperors. Moonlight passed through the oculus located at the center of the ceiling. Claradore often made his speeches at that exact location. Texts from the Grimoire of Red passing as the Faith’ hymns were chanted by the choir. The people attending the service were no less the wiser.

She glanced at the long line in front of the eight soup cauldrons. Women, children, the elderly, slaves, freed slaves, all wearing plain tunics. It seemed the line has gotten lengthier ever since that problem with the Elysian Empire started last month...Has Claradore cooked enough? Would there be enough seats?

One by one they came. Smiling at each one, she filled two spoonfuls in every bowl. Spoon was an understatement for the utensil Claradore had given to her dwarfed the largest of Baba’s spatulas. Children got an additional piece of candy. All thanked Claradore and Emperor Ralens. #emph[What would have they done without the Red Guild?]

The night continued with her cleaning the emptied tables. During the resurgence of the Plague of Anastasian, she used to wipe all of the eighty tables within the nave. Today, only forty needed cleaning. Perhaps she would have the time to walk Spartak in the evening. Did she not promise him his favorite steak a moon ago?

"One bowl, please Nix," said a familiar voice under a hood. A boy no more than fourteen summers stood before her.

"You snuck out again?!? What are you thinking? There are still muggers lurking around!" she whispered.

"Please! Don’t tell Claradore! "

"Let me guess, you also tried to bring your sister along, but she slapped you."

"Hehe. You know Livia. She never walks outside without a litter. Can I have a bowl now? Goddess please? It looks so appetizing!"

"Fine, you owe me for this!"

Nix sat down with the boy who removed his hood. She never resisted the urge to pat his curly hair. Him and her friend’s Serena had adopted the same style. "Stop that tickles," he always said.

"Why would you skip caviar at the palace to eat in the Studion of all places?"

Prince Ralens the Younger gobbled the bowl whole causing her to burst out laughing. "Claradore and Father told me I should strive to be closer to the people. What better way than to eat and sit with them?" #emph[Always too good for your own good.]

"Claradore told me that your father is ill..."

A round of applause reverberated through the church. She turned. Claradore had come, greeting his congregation. Kisses on the cheeks, handshakes and prayers. He personally lifted sacks of grain to be distributed. She knew the drill. The Magister Herboraum carried a notebook with him. From handing over medicine, petitions to the Emperor himself, inconsistencies with the grain dole, anything was written on the calepin. "The Faith has long forgotten what generosity is. Let our kindness be the greatest weapon against them," once said Claradore. He toured all who were fed before stopping at her table.

"It seems we have quite the bold guest, tonight. It is an honor to have you here, my dear student," said Claradore, showing that disarming smile, the one he had shown her on that terrible day at Baba’s house.

"I noted the prices of items, Magister Herboraum as you suggested!" said Ralens.

"What have you noticed, my dear student?"

"Silk and all fruits from the Unknown World have more than doubled in price."

Claradore stroked his chin. "Do you understand why?"

"The Elysians. The Emperor of Kings Nosrau sent their ultimatum last week. F-father has not answered it yet."

"You have only mentioned the prices of luxury goods so far, my dear student. The common folk have no ears for geopolitics. They care however when their subsistence is threatened. Tell me, have you written down the price of a kilogram of rice or half a kilo of chicken breasts?" said Claradore.

Ralens the Younger returned a blank stare. "Uhhhhhhhhh....."

"Then take the opportunity on your way back to take a look at them. I also noticed, my dear, that you have only used your eyes so far. Have your others senses reported anything?"

"No, you told me to watch, and so I did. Eyes are a ruler’s most important assets. Without them, I would not be able to see if my subjects love me or not."

"My dear student, smell and hearing are as essential to an emperor as eyesight. Lips do not always convey betrayal and subterfuge. You need words to gauge the intentions of your courtiers, your enemies and your presumed friends. Smell them too, the people you surround yourself with... A sick body emits an unpleasant odor, does it not? A strong perfume can mask insecurities or one’s true beliefs, does it not? The greatest of all detectives use all of their senses to strip men and women of their inner thoughts. An emperor should do the same should he not want to end like the last Tiarmat Emperors."

If defeat could be drawn as a facial expression, Ralens the Younger’s visage would be the living embodiment of such a word. Mouth agape. Eyes wide with incomprehension. Hands on the head. Nix suppressed a laugh. She had made similar faces the first time Claradore had tutored her.

"Oh and the Excubitores hung some criminals tonight. One of them came from Miroconium, your city, Nix," said Ralens the Younger.

If Nix was a dog, her ears would have sprung up. Maybe. Maybe it was him.

"Was he a priest? A Faithful?" said Nix.

"I don’t think so. It was a father who ran away from the town. They said he had killed his wife."

Nix cursed in her head. She had never stopped dreaming about seeing the Man in White’s head mounted on a spike. One of these days. She will find him. She had promised Baba that much.

"Father also told me we are expecting a new Cardinal by the end of the month, a man by the name of Boniface."

"I will be delighted to meet this newcomer. It is a shame Cardinal Innocentus had to leave this world so soon," said Claradore.

#emph[Hopefully, the new Cardinal won’t be as nosy as Innocentus.]

Sending Cardinals and Men of the Crucible to early retirement had become a pastime for Claradore. These kinds of men could never be allowed to know the truth. Magi and the Faith could not walk the same plane of existence. By condemning the Sunken Continent, she had ensured that only one of them could dominate the Known World.

"The hour is getting late, my dear student. Nix, please escort our lord back to the palace," said Claradore.

Claradore was right. She had a long day ahead of her tomorrow with Serena.

"I’ll clean your room while I am at it. Did Mr. Mittens shit on the bed again?" said Nix.
