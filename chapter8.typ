The princess Livia had departed for her summer residence alongside Domitian. 
Nix relished such opportunities for she was able to sneak into the purple born's 
room. 

The golden gilded door creaked open. Livia's perfume, made of jasmine and roses
caught her nose. An arsenal of dresses, stolas and coats fluttered in the gargantuan
wardrobe. Flickering candles shone on the opulent shades of purple, rose, crimson and gold. 

Nix walked on the mosaic floor which depicted the Goddess' final departure from the 
land of the living. Her hands made their way into Livia's army of robes. 
Her guilty pleasure had been to wear clothes that she could never purchase.
Her fingers touched the softest silk, the brightest rose, the warmest feathers.
Nix could feel her own face turn green. It was never fair.

She found the object of her desires: this long flowing gown with a mantle of gold 
binding the neckline. A crimson cape embroidered with the Medean phoenix extended 
from the back of the outfit. Livia had only worn the attire once during her 
engagement to Domitian. Why even bother commissioning the dress if you only wore it 
a single time?

_The purple born and their eccentricities_ thought Nix.

She removed her handmaiden clothes and put on the gown.

Before her stood a girl who dreamed to become a princess. For this one night, Nix 
would grant that girl's wishes. 

Sitting in front of Livia's mirror, Nix combed her hair in the exact same manner 
as Livia. The princess' armada of perfume bottles tempted her. Yet the flagrance 
that interested her was the ornate bottle shaped like a dragon. Only one woman in 
the Known World could possess that scent, one that commanded authority. Foreign dignitaries would be in awe of smelling such a perfume that seemed to transcend 
human senses. Nix would put two droplets on her neck.

And at last came the princess' crown, this diadem encrusted with the now exiled empress Thessaly's jewels. Nix knew the rubies adorning the crown would suit her 
head. Her hands deposited the ornament on herself.

_Why can't it all be mine?_ thought Nix.

She rotated around the room, contemplating how the attire magnified her 
elegance. Nix smiled. Perhaps, she could borrow the gown indefinitely. The purple born did not understand the privilege the Goddess 
bestowed them upon birth.

A cough came from under the princess' bed. Nix yelped.

"Wh-Wh-Who is there?" said Nix.

A man or rather a boy of her age crawled from under his hiding spot. 
He was Majorian, a cousin of prince Ralens. Interestingly enough, he shared 
something in common with her. For he too indulged in borrowing Livia's clothes.
His face reddened under Livia's purple stola.

Unlike Nix, the Faith would crucify him if they ever caught him wearing that.
Had Majorian been a higher ranking official, Nix could have extracted much concessions from him. But this purple born was just a boy, a Scholae Palatinae.
The Red Guild had no uses for another spy. 

_What to do with you?_ thought Nix.

"I-I mean no harm," said Majorian in the Classical Tongue.

"Quite the original attire you are wearing."

"Please...Please...Do not tell the princess. I'll do anything!"

"The Emperor is fair play then?"

Color drained from Majorian's face. Nix laughed.

"I was teasing you, it seems we both hold secrets. It would be troublesome if 
you revealed mine," said Nix.

"I will not denounce you! I swear upon the Goddess' name!"

Nix noticed that his eyes strayed away from hers. His brown curls were more 
ravishing than prince Ralens'. Livia's purple stola espoused his build, layering 
femininity upon masculinity.

"What do you think about my gown?" asked Nix.

Majorian's face was petrified. To him, Nix must have appeared like an Elysian 
princess. They said that the Emperor of Kings Nosrau's line descended from the Firstborn's celestial domain. They were angels that brought salvation to the 
Elysian populace, liberating them from the Goddess' tyranny. Any mortal would be in awe before these angelic beings.

"St-Stunning, my Lady." said Majorian.

My Lady. Two words that sent tremors of pleasure down Nix's spine. Yes, that was 
what she aspired to be named. If only everyone could refer to her by those two words. Nix was destined for royalty. All bones and flesh within her very being clamored for the divine right to rule.

"You are clever one. Words don't sway me so easily. How long have you 
entertained this...habit of yours?" said Nix.

"Ever since my eleventh's summer, my Lady."

The sound of boots clattering in the corridor alerted her. Majorian gasped as her hands dragged him under Livia's bed. His breath was pressed against her left hand. She smelled one of Livia's pomegranate flagrances on him. His tastes were arguably poorer than hers.

Two sets of boots entered the tiled floor. Nix deduced they were Excurbitores by the weight of their footsteps. 

"I swore someone yelped here," said one Excurbitore with a thick Clovian accent.

"Must have been rats," said a second Excurbitore.

"Inform the emperor that rat catchers will be needed."

Their boots left the room. Nix and Majorian laid for minutes under the bed. 
They only extirpated themselves out of their hiding place once no sound could be 
heard from the corridor.

"Our lives could have been forfeited," said Majorian.

"There is beauty in danger," said Nix.

"What?"

"You are a soldier, are you not? Do not lie to me. The thrill of danger arouses you."

His lips stood inches away from hers. Nix touched his warm hand. Sweat ran from his 
forehead. Was today the day an Elysian handmaiden conquered a Medean prince? The Elysian poets would dissect this story until the end of times.

"Are you sure?" he said.

"Only if you can keep a secret."

"I am a Scholae Palatinae. Keeping secrets is my vocation."

Her lips closed the distance. Nix tasted his sweetness, rivaling the finest wine. 
His hands grabbed her waist. Nix snuffed the candle on Livia's desk as she sauntered into Livia's bed.
