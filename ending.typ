Erratic shamans collected still beating hearts from the crucified sacrifices. Convicts, rapists, killers, all unwanted by Medean society. Some of the Faithful from the riots were brought in. Haggard men and women with denailed hands.

The shamans squeezed the hearts with their elongated nails, smearing blood on their thumb. They blessed the auxiliary palatine guards’ forehead with the bloodied fingertip. Like the finest dramaturge, the priests’ devotion made her shudder. Guttural throat singing accompanied the ceremony held in the Hippodrome. It would be the last thing the Faithful and the Firsborn’s acolytes would hear when she would liberate their soil.

All were provided the ultimate path to redemption by serving as sacrifices. The moment Livia had awaited the entirety of her adulthood came. Finally. She would be able to forge a new canvas. The Known World was due for a full redo of its dull map. Serena had been fond of plain colors separated by borders. Livia preferred uniformity. Shades purple and red would color her painting. She had learned that differences only let to conflict. If one wanted to purge the stains and blemishes out of a canvas, one needed just a single color to dominate the painting. One religion. One empire. One ruler. Simplicity ensured stability.

#emph[The Goddess is dead, and the Known World does not know it.]

Ordogan and Livia passed through the kneeling columns of heavy infantry, an audience she had never gotten enough of. What did those men think of her? Her who had slain a god. If only they knew that magic had returned. If only they knew that magic was allowing her to wear their empress like a lavish gown. Shamans traversed the formation, providing all men with the pagan ritual. Gold phoenixes, the standards of the army, hovered above the 50 000 men who awaited their orders. Thunderclouds amassed over the Medean foedorati. War horses clad in scale armor complained about the occasional lightning bolt.

Livia imagined the statues she could build with all what was confiscated from the Faithful’s churches. All the gold and silver they had seized from the corrupt clergymen could fit inside the palace’s amphitheater. She thought of what she could build with all those riches. A thirty meters tall bronze colossus dedicated to her in the middle of Thanatopolis or one in the memory of Baba who had initiated all of this. A monument that would stand the test of time. She had been that small child that had admired these kinds of works.

"Look at Empress Livia who defeated the Goddess herself," would say the children who would read books and encyclopedias on her. Such was her legacy as the last Magi.

Children. To the east and west laid other countries still ensnared by the Faith’s lies. Countless children suffered, deprived of their parents, watching as so-called witches burned under men who served the Goddess only in name. The demise of the thing called Serena guaranteed that churches and countries will burn. The house of cards that the Goddess has built would collapse, allowing Livia to build a new golden palace atop its flaming ruins.

The emperor’s lounge overlooked the racetrack. There, two auxiliary palatine guarded manned a gong. A mallet struck the metal disc every fifteen minutes, indicating a pause for meditation. She closed her eyes when the gong called. The memory came back. Her standing at this exact same position dressed in rags looking at a girl smiling in condescension in purple silk. That girl and Domitian. To think she would always be looking down on them in the present. The Empress Thessaly and Ralens the Elder had sat in the lounge, flaunting their diadems and scepters. Livia had remembered kneeling with the other handmaidens before a race. #emph[All of it is mine now...]

"Will 50 000 men be enough?" Livia asked, her face covered by a cavalry mask. The thunderstorm drowned her voice.

"The Elysians invaded with 80 000 soldiers. They say the Emperor of Kings himself leads the host with his two sons: Sassan and Yazram," said Ordogan. She smelled his cologne, a melancholic story eschewed through tangy brine, crisp incense, all commanded by the intelligent aroma of black ink accord.

#emph[First the Elysians then the rest of the Babarian nations. After all, no one. No one. No one will be able to burn my home again.]

Heavy infantry sheltered Livia under a bamboo umbrella. She raised her arm to shield her handlers from the rain. "Those mongrels believe a prophecy will lead them to victory. The Oracle presumably said that 'An Elysian will preside over the Known World'," said Livia.

"Superstition is not the only factor determining the outcome of a war. That Elysian army was mustered hastily. A foreign land will prove itself inhospitable for such a large force."

"The Oracle is aid to be infallible," said Livia Ordogan chortled. Should it be true, who do you think the prophecy refers to? Nosrau? Doubtful, the decrepit old man nears his 80th summer. Yazram? The Elysians cultivate his image as a flawless being with meticulous care?

"The battlefield will tell if he is as invincible as they say. Vague and meaningless prophecies are the way to render them infallible. Let the Elysians believe in their fairy tales and illusions of invincibility," said Ordogan.

"Fairy tales are far from what is being reported in the eastern provinces. I have heard what they have done to Zastrianpolis...Despicable savages..."

"The garrison fought admirably... My heart weeps for the soldiers who were buried alive by the Elysians."

"How so, Magister Militum?"

"Your brother, the Emperor, forbade retaliatory actions, your August Majesty. The scroll mentions magnanimity. The Emperor wishes our men to treat the Elysians with dignity and respect. A vain ideal in my humble opinion." #emph[Always too kind for your own good, brother. But I prefer you that way...]

"My brother forgets his history lessons. Two decades ago, Father had 10 000 Rauthengardian raiders boiled alive for ransacking imperial lands. Peace was brought to the western frontier ever since."

Ordogan nodded. "Aggressors do not respect you if they have yet to know fear. Nosrau is no exception."

"You may disregard his suggestion. My brother is a gentle soul, unbroken by the hardships of war. He sees evil in necessity. Every emperor clings to the childish delusion that wars will end with their honor unscathed. Stand among the tens of thousands of women and children slaughtered by the Elysians and ask their ghosts if honor still matters. Their silence is your answer."

"Will that not conflict with the Emperor’s orders?"

"I command the army, not Ralens, Master of Armies. Remember, you answer only to me."

Ordogan bowed before her. The gong was struck anew. The shamans waited at the Hydra Column, gesturing at the Goddess’ Bowl. The headless torso belonging to Alexander was crucified above. Blood tricked down into the Goddess’ Bowl. Ordogan and Livia plunged their heads in the sacred bowl. In the waters, she closed her eyes, contemplating herself. #emph[I have made it this far. I will not let a deranged Elysian Emperor endanger my crown. Nosrau shall learn that I am not to be trifled with.]

She and Ordogan emerged from the Goddess’ Bowl. Blood splattered on her purple silk garments. "To Victory! Victory!" they spoke in unison.

An Excubitore handed to her The Lance of True Redemption, the famed lance that Regnant the Dragonslayer had used a millennium ago. It looked the same as it did in Baba’s encyclopedias, the purest gold with doves and dragons carved into it. The names of all the dragons slain by Regnant were written using the Forgotten Tongue’s finest calligraphy. Dried blood from the Last Dragon still soaked the speartip. Livia grabbed it and raised it with her two hands over her army.

"Behold! The Lance of True Redemption!" Livia said with her mature voice.

"To Victory! Victory!" roared the army. Dismounted cataphracts with plumed helmets applauded her alongside the Molochian horse archers. The auxiliary palatine guards stood up, pounding their spears against their shields. Trumpets, horns and drums blared throughout the hippodrome. A massive Medean flag with its crimson phoenix was hoisted in the upper stands. Livia exulted in her men’s admiration. She bowed before them.

With her bloody spear, she struck at Alexander’s corpse.

"Men of the Medean Empire, you have lived through a life of deceit. The creature that came here was a false Goddess. It was but an artificial abomination, a monster that tried to eat me alive and murdered my dear father. Today is the day that her deception ends. Follow me, and you never know deceit again!" said Livia.

"Death to the False Goddess and her followers!" chanted the soldiers. Livia smiled.

"It is an auspicious day, isn’t it? Let us set forth a new age, one ruled by us men and women. Let us free the other nations from the yoke of the False Goddess to bring them prosperity, civilization and peace. Let us save the children from her corruption. It is our destiny. Let us mend the halves of our broken empire!"
