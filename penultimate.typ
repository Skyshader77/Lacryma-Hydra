It rained cinder and ashes. Calcined corpses fell down from the sky. 
Livia traversed the ruins of the Exiles' Island in her litter, the same she and Domitian had always used. Scenes of the foundation of the Sarvitarian Empire were painted in the inside. Then, Sarvitar had murdered his own twin brother upon the the Seventh Hill, taking the mantle of King. This normalized kinslaying as a means to attain absolute power. Was slaying another Magi kinslaying? 

Ordogan walked next to her gilded carriage. Cataphracts led the procession of caparisoned slaves. Excubitores formed a squared shield wall around her.

A crater now stood at the Forge's location.  
Molochian horse archers scoured the desolate wasteland ahead of the main army. Crows flew overhead. The air was ripe with smoke and blood. In the distance she glimpsed the glistening domes of the Palace Complex. 
The shield wall advanced at a slow pace, carefully inspecting every debris for signs of the enemy. At most, they found scattered limbs and scorched skulls.

The pretext she gave was to find the Emperor. As a Purpleborn, she could let the fate of her own brother hang in uncertainty. Livia had to give the pretense of effort in determining his condition. Livia had to resist the temptation of rushing outside barefooted. She had to know. She had to ascertain her triumph. The probability of Sixtus surviving years' worth of concentrated Medean fire was infinitesimal. 

She could not believe that the execution of her designs had not dented Thanatopolis itself. The populace witnessed the once in a century firestorm from the shores ten imperial miles away. The official pamphlets and decrees only mentioned disposing of aging stockpiles of Medean Empire. Livia's face curled into a smile. It was quite the irony that she would attain her greatest victory without using any magic. Claradore had been right. There was no Second Age of Magic.

One of the Molochian horse archers shouted something. The rest of the foederati brandished their bows. Livia slide the litter's door.

What remained of Sixtus laid before her eyes. The slaves carrying her litter yelped, causing the vehicle to list rightwards. Livia hung to the handles of the litter to stop herself from falling. The only thing she recognized in Sixtus was his crimson eye still radiating zealotry. It was almost miraculous that his eye remained intact. He had become an amalgam of burned bones and flesh, clutching what was left of his intestines. Crows and vultures pecked at his skull. _He lives,_ thought Livia.

The Giant glared at her. His skull gritted his ashes ridden teeth. Livia was aware that he aspired to cast an incantation. But with what vigor? The man still lived on the energy of sheer piousness and hatred. 

Ordogan lunged at the monstrosity. With his ceremonial blade, he struck the Giant's skull. A horrible sound ensued. Light vanished from Sixtus's eye.
It was done. The Giants were no more.

"What is to be done with the corpse?" asked an Excubitore.

"It would be wise to burn it," said Livia.

And so they erected a pyre. The flames licked the Giant's body. Body parts belonging to Margrub Dogas were thrown in the fire. Only bones were to be brought back to Thanatopolis. Livia wished for her struggle against the Giant to be immortalized in the annals of imperial history. Let the people gaze in fear at the remains of the monsters she has slain. Let them know that it was the Faith who bred these abominations.

When no man paid attention to the fire, Livia threw Baba's skull in it. Everything from her expulsion from her childhood home to the demise of Serena culminated in her obtaining a throne for herself. _Thank you, Baba, for everything,_ thought Livia.

The men combed every ruin and fragment of brick for the Emperor. Any limb they could find was identified before being fed to the flames. Twilight came. 
The Medeans would come to the same conclusion she had come to.

"The Emperor is dead," said Ordogan. 

Livia let tears fall from her eyes. This path was forced upon her by Sixtus himself. She began sobbing. 

"The Faith is truly cruel. My father, my fiancé and now my brother. Has the Goddess not have mercy on my soul? Have not I suffered enough?" said Livia.

What the Red Guild achieved was at most pyrrhic victory. Serena, Majorian, Baba, Ralens and Claradore had either paid with their lives or their bodies. And Livia walked over their bones to reach the seat of power she now sat on. Marble statues would be sculpted in their honor and placed in every provincial capital. Plazas, atriums, libraries and schools would be renamed after them.

"Their sacrifices will not be forgotten," said Ordogan.

"Seven days of mourning will be decreed." 

"The Apocalypse. Can we truly claim to have turned the tide?"

"Sixtus was but a head among a hydra. You and I have seen how monsters rule the world, Magister Militum. Unity is of utmost importance. Our combined strength has vanquished one of them. More surely stir in Metarexia and Persiphon."

"The Rauthengardians and Elysians dwell in the same state of oblivion as we did. Monsters blending in with humans. Magi binding entire nations in chains. My stomach turns at the very thought. A new Emperor must free them from the shackles of the Magi."

Livia nodded. 

"The Rauthengardians and Elysians will not sit idle once word spreads that a second emperor has died. This country needs stability, strength. It needs a capable Emperor, Magister Militum," said Livia. 

"You cannot possibly mean?" said Ordogan, his visage crisped by disbelief. 

"You and I both know what needs to be done to please the people." 

"It has come to this...The Goddess plays games with us, does she?"

She flashed her disarming smile. 
"Will you take join your house with mine? Do you accept the Purple?"

Livia was pleased that the proposition left Ordogan speechless. The strategos of the Empire had never anticipated the possibility of ever ascending to the throne as a half-Molochian. Livia could only guess what thoughts were echoing in the general's head. Would he decline the crown as Claradore did? Would he offer another candidate? 

The crucial part of his decision rested on whether he thought sitting on the throne was an honorable decision. Livia would not have asked the question if she had not considered his thought process. He could only provide one answer to her question and that was the answer she wanted.

Ordogan breathed heavily. Sixtus's blood trickled down his tired eyes. She closed the distance, caressing his warm cheeks with her well manicured hands.
She was well aware that no man in the Known World could maintain their composure in front of a Purpleborn's visage when it was adorned with the rarest cosmetics the Known World could offer. He was a fortress to assault and everything from her eyeliner to her lipstick were battery rams and siege towers. How many minutes or seconds would it take for him to yield? She knew his mind had already capitulated. But what about his heart?

"The Empire needs a man of your talents to lead it," said Livia. It was the truth. Two emperors had passed away in less than a year. Soon, the vultures of the Rauthengardian and the Elysian Empires would rear their ugly heads. They saw weakness and would exploit it. They would provide her the perfect casus belli. Medean armies would first thrust east to conquer the Elysian Empire before swinging back west. With the Goddess and Sixtus erased from existence, 
the Known World belonged to Magi anew.

The smell of Ordogan's clove scented breath brought her back to reality. 
Ordogan grabbed her hand and knelt down before her. Molochian horse archers 
watched, their mouths agape. The cataphracts dismounted to bow before her.

"It will be an honor to reign in these trying times," said Ordogan.

Livia removed her crown, putting it on his head. 

"I have waited a long time for this, Magister Militum, no Emperor," said Livia.

Their lips met. She savored his flavor which was similar to the finest wine 
fermented by decades of glorious battlefield victories.

_An Elysian and a Molochian on the throne. The Sarvitarians must be rolling in their graves,_ thought Livia.


The Andamite Stairs of the Palace Complex had been cleaned of any speckle of dust.
On this auspicious day, she chose to cloak herself in a purple gown patterned with the Tiarmat hydra. Her mother's medallion hung from her neck. Thanatopolis itself had stopped breathing. All gathered in the streets for the coronation of their new Emperor.

Livia and Ordogan walked down the Andamite Stairs. He was dressed in a resplendent purple tunic with phoenix and dragon motifs intertwining in what appeared to be the Battle of Hecatopolis. Columns of Excubitores and Scholae Palatinae flanked both sides of the streets. Massed citizens erupted in thunderous applause. 

"Victory to Emperor Ordogan!" they shouted in the Imperial Tongue.

She wore the unique flagrance of saffron, jasmine and rose that only the Medean Empress could possess. The populace could smell her. She wanted them to. It was her birthright, her divine right. 

Trumpets, mechanical birds and drums sang their symphony behind the imperial couple. She held Ordogan's hand, his hold reeking of trust. They marched through the colonnaded streets. below Charov's Aqueduct, before entering the Plaza of Kornikus' arches. 

A chorus of cheers greeted them.

"Here to His August Majesty Ordogan!" proclaimed the orators, spider tattoos covering their necks. One by one children came, delivering to them goods from her favorite shrimp dumplings to flowery wreaths. Ordogan held them in his arms. 
Her old self would have never bathed with the denizens. Yet Livia aspired to be an empress of the people. 
It was her destiny to lead the Empire to greater heights. The drums of war were beating, and the populace needed total and blinding confidence in their mistress.

It was a dream come true. Livia had never believed in fairy tales but maybe once this time, she could imagine herself living in one. The witch and the talented general at the zenith of this country? The poets, writers and philosophers of the future would do a vivisection of this for the centuries to come.
