It rained cinder and ashes. Calcined corpses fell down from the sky. 
Livia walked among the ruins of the Exiles' Island.  A crater now stood at the Forge's location. Excubitores formed a shield wall in front of her. The air was ripe with smoke and blood. 

She had to ascertain her triumph. The probability of Alexander surviving years' worth of concentrated Medean fire was infinitesimal. It was quite the irony that she would attain her greatest victory without using any magic. Claradore had been right. There was no Second Age of Magic.

Ordogan and Molochian horse archers scoured the desolate wasteland. Crows flew overhead. 

"The Emperor is dead," said Ordogan.

Livia let tears fall from her eyes. This path was forced upon her by Alexander himself. She began sobbing. 

"The Faith is truly cruel. My father, my fiance and now my brother. Has the Goddess not have mercy on my soul? Have I suffered enough?" said Livia.

What the Red Guild achieved was at most pyrrhic victory. Serena, Majorian, Baba, Ralens and Claradore had either paid with their lives or their bodies. And Livia walked over their bones to reach the seat of power she now sat on. 

"Their sacrifices will not be forgotten," said Ordogan.

A Molochian horse archer came to their location. 

"My Lord, we found...something," he said in the Imperial Tongue.

"The Apocalypse..." said Ordogan.

"Must be thwarted. You and I have seen how monsters rule the world, Magister Militum. Unity is of utmost importance. Our combined strength has vanquished one of them. More must await us at Metarexia."

"This country needs an Emperor, Magister Militum," said Livia.

"You cannot possibly mean?" said Ordogan.

"You and I both know what needs to be done to please the people. Will you take my hand in marriage?"

Livia was pleased that the proposition left Ordogan speechless. The strategos of the Empire had never anticipated the possibility of ever ascending to the throne as a half-Molochian. Livia could only guess what thoughts were echoing in the general's head. Would he decline the crown as Claradore did? Would he offer another candidate? 

Ordogan breathed heavily. Alexander's blood trickled down his tired eyes. She closed the distance, caressing his warm cheeks with her well manicured hands.
She was well aware that no man in the Known World could maintain their composure in front of a Purpleborn's visage when it was adorned with the rarest cosmetics the Known World could offer. He was a fortress to assault and everything from her eyeliner to her lipstick were battery rams and siege towers.

"The Empire needs a man of your talents to lead it," said Livia. It was the truth. Two emperors had passed away in less than a year. Soon, the vultures of the Rauthengardian and the Elysian Empires would rear their ugly heads. They saw weakness and would exploit it.

He grabbed her hand. "It will be an honor to reign in these trying times."

_An Elysian and a Molochian on the throne. The Sarvitarians must be rolling in their graves,_ thought Livia.
