"The Apocalypse..." said Ordogan.

"Must be thwarted. You and I have seen how monsters rule the world, Magister Militum. Unity is of utmost importance. Our combined strength has vanquished one of them. More must await us at Metarexia."

"This country needs an Emperor, Magister Militum," said Livia.

"You cannot possibly mean?" said Ordogan.

"You and I both know what needs to be done to please the people. Will you take my hand in marriage?"

Livia was pleased that the proposition left Ordogan speechless. The strategos of the Empire had never anticipated the possibility of ever ascending to the throne as a half-Molochian. Livia could only guess what thoughts were echoing in the general's head. Would he decline the crown as Claradore did? Would he offer another candidate? 

Ordogan breathed heavily. Alexander's blood trickled down his tired eyes. She closed the distance, caressing his warm cheeks with her well manicured hands.
She was well aware that no man in the Known World could maintain their composure in front of a Purpleborn's visage when it was adorned with the rarest cosmetics the Known World could offer. He was a fortress to assault and everything from her eyeliner to her lipstick were battery rams and siege towers.

"The Empire needs a man of your talents to lead it," said Livia. It was the truth. Two emperors had passed away in less than a year. Soon, the vultures of the Rauthengardian and the Elysian Empires would rear their ugly heads. They saw weakness and would exploit it.

He grabbed her hand. "It will be an honor to reign in these trying times."

_An Elysian and a Molochian on the throne. The Sarvitarians must be rolling in their graves,_ thought Livia.
