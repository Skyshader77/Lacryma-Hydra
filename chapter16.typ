Her favorite hosts were cats. Nimble, quiet and small. Perfect for this kind of operation. Save of course Mr Mittens whose fat body would not even fit within the Hippodrome’s gates.

Spartak and her swam beneath the sea of humanity that were the streets of the imperial capital. While as a human she would have to force her way through the crowd, tolerating the usual evening scents of armpits and alcohol, as a cat, there were close to no obstacles underneath people’s legs. However, Nix was not sure that humans outnumbered cats seeing the large amount of her compatriots idling around or querying men and women for free food. It was both scary and impressive how humans looked as animals. From a cat’s point of view, one could understand why men were feared. Their hands, gigantic and flexible. Shields, swords and lances held by the patrolling Scholae Palatinae or the Vigiles, all looked sharper and deadlier as a cat. Being a feline had taught her to be wary of any sudden move. From a dog staring at her with vicious intent to the children racing to grab her. All of these experiences had made her faster as a human. Thanatopolis never slept. Her whiskers tingled every time that they came into contact with the smell of those shrimp or lobster dumplings, a delicacy she could not afford right now as an animal. #emph[Shame.] Ignoring the children who would stop to pat her, she went into the deserted Hippodrome which from her perspective was even more colossal. It seemed the marble statues of Zenobia, Regnant, Vitiatius, Zastrian and Charov were these Giants of the Age of Magic. Sand. Nix loathed how it felt on her paws. Yet this sensation was nothing compared to the pleasure she had of chasing Spartak around the racetrack. Hide and seek used to be her favorite pastime here. To any onlooker, it would seem that a cat was meowing excessively at a much larger canine. It might even look bizarre to see a dog cuddle a cat so affectionately. Both of their furs sharing their warmth. An utter bliss. Indescribable, this feeling that no other human in this current time could experience. Nix was lucky.

She would often climb to the last row of the stands. Even then, the Marroan Walls looked majestic. Her cat instincts knew they were unclimbable, the only limitation of this body. Then, she would look at the stars above, making innocent wishes or contemplating her dream alongside with Spartak. They would cuddle each other, watching the lighthouses illuminate the quinqueremes and dromons docking. There were now thrice as many warships than last year. Nix could only speculate about their intended destination. Below then, the sea of torches that was Thanatopolis breathed. It moved, contained by the walls every night, animated by harps and drums who tried to match its tempo. It was here that she had realized how small her own existence was. Nix was but an insignificant dot in the annals of human history, condemned to be forgotten once she faded away like the wide majority of humans. #emph[Moments like this never last] She looked at her paw the same way she did with that fox on that day. Claws. Yes, very useful for tearing apart the mice. Yet it was not mice she wanted to hunt on this moonless night.

"Come, Spartak. There will be more opportunities to play once we are done," Nix said. She never understood if Spartak could comprehend the cat’s tongue. It followed her though.

She and Spartak arrived at the doors of the Church of Holy Sacrimony whose walls Nix had so often scaled as a child. Her cat ears heard the Faith’s hymns and lies emanating from the choir. Dilapidated stained-glass, streaks of grime ran on the once shiny bronze doors. A fresh pig’s head even laid at the entrance, probably courtesy of one of those people who had lost a loved one during the Plague of Anastasian. Nix knew Claradore wanted to demolish this rotten building to build an even greater church in honor of the True Goddess. Yes, the True Goddess, the one that had been turned into a spider by her own twin. A most brainless story. The Goddess, her twin and Regnant the Dragonslayer. Claradore never minced his words when speaking about the truth, the truth that the Faith had wanted to eclipse for a millennium. The Age of Magic. It all ended because of one girl’s jealousy. An entire continent, sunken by envy.

Someone stepped on her tail. Spartak barked cheerfully, treacherously wagging his tail at Serena who shone with exuberance tonight. #emph[So much from man’s best friend.]

"Apologies, pumpkin face, I did not mean to startle you," said Serena as she looked at the vial of gray liquid carried by Nix. Nix meowed angrily. She and Claradore had spent the better part of the afternoon brewing this inodorous concoction from ingredients which names had long changed from the days of the Grimoire of Red.

"And where do you think you are going with that?"

Boniface, they called the Man in White Boniface. The first inch of progress she had made in eight summers. If this Boniface proved as gentle as his name would have her believe, what kind of creature would Cardinal Shitface be? Probably the most docile and compassionate man Nix would ever meet. The Goddess was truly cruel in her humor.

It had surprised Nix how little of the Boniface’s time was spent outside the church. Having two hundred Men of the Crucible at your command was indeed an incentive to never leave the confines of your self-made palace. As a human, Nix had been turned away by the most rude of Men of the White whose breath had reeked of wine and cavities. It was then that she had noticed that the Men of the Crucible would invite a few stray animals into the building for refreshments. Animals, the guilty weakness of all humanity. Had the Goddess granted them superior intelligence, dogs and cats could have been made into the ideal assassination devices. None of course would ever suspect Mr.Mittens of plotting its owner’s demise.

Serena grabbed Nix’ body, patting its fur. The hypnotic massage made Nix’ eyes flutter. Each stroke of her spine sent waves of repose. Her muscles wanted to melt in a sea of calmness. After all, the plan she had hoped to realize necessitated such level headness.

Nix slipped out of Serena’s arms, starting a catwalk towards the Church of Sacrimony. Serena and Spartak followed under the trustful eye of the Man of the Crucible that had scorned her before.

In the nave, eunuchs sat in the seats praying at the discolored statue of the Goddess. A figure cloaked in purple stood at the altar conversing with the Man in White.

#emph[What is she doing here?]

"I’ll take care of this for you, pumpkin face," whispered Serena as she took the vial from Nix’ neck. Nix purred. Separation of concerns had been the hallmark of her friendship with Serena. Her friend had guessed that the vial should be poured into the church’s fountain, the one that collected water from Charov’s Aqueduct. When one was faced with a fortress, one had to convince the defenders of abandoning their stronghold. Such was the doctrine the great Sarvitar had followed during his conquests of the modern day Clovian Domain. The Commentaries, his illustrious self biography, found their way on the bookshelves of all libraries of the Medean Empire.

Nix raised her paw. Serena tapped it with her dominant hand before leaving the trio, Spartak and Nix battled the other stray animals for the leftover chicken breast the Men of the Crucible fed them.

Behind them, Livia prostrated herself before the statue of the Goddess, kissing its hands and feet.

"You seem afraid, my child," said the Man in White. His hands fiddled with this skull encrusted with diamonds as if trying to solve an imaginary puzzle.

"Spiders. They haunt me, Father Boniface. I see them everywhere, in my dreams, within me," said Livia.

"Spiders? The Goddess has many ways to communicate with the Faithful, my child. We all know she works in mysterious ways. Even the most illustrious of humans cannot hope to grasp her brightness."

#emph[Are all men of the Faith garrulous?]

"The Goddess cannot be at cause here, Father. No one believes me. I have felt them. Crawling under my skin. Using my own body, my own voice against me… Do you have any idea of the horror I was forced to witness? Demons, Father. They exist."

"A demon within you? Are you certain? Are you sure you are not being blessed by The Goddess’ most precious gift, that of life: life in the womb."

Livia glared at him.

"My apologies, your Grace…Throughout my career, I have seen examples of blatant disregard to the dignity of human life from conception to natural death."

"I am telling the truth, Father. There was a demon inhabiting me the other night."

#emph[Demon? Magic has nothing to do with demons you spoiled brat!]

"An enemy striking from within. Intriguing. There are cases you might be interested in, your Grace. Your brother has granted us access to Cardinal Innocentus’ body, child… Our physicians have come up with disturbing conclusions."

"You believe he has been murdered. What evidence do you have?"

Nix crept up the altar, ordering Spartak to stay put with her paw. She meowed softly. Both Livia and Boniface smiled at her. #emph[Pick me up, fools!] By an unfortunate turn of events, Nix had to settle for Livia holding her in her arms. She exposed the cat’s belly, taunting the princess to rub it. And so the purple born did. What would have Claradore or Baba called this? A spider in cat’s clothing? Or a gold coin in cat’s clothing?

"Your Grace…The Goddess knows how, but it seems his veins have imploded…"

"It must be Claradore! He had no love for Innocentus…I have seen what he has done to my father. A once proud king reduced to a husk of a man. How I’ve wept every time that vile man had whispered into my father’s ears…"

"A most grave accusation, your Grace. Yet not unheard of for a man who has strayed from the Goddess’ path. Such a man cannot be allowed near the throne."

"Heal, your Grace. We must remedy the disease that is strangling the Empire from within. The Goddess is Nature itself. A firestorm we shall start. Wildfires are started so that nature can heal itself."

"But if the fire is too large, my brother will have to seek the arsonist."

"Very good, your Grace. What we want here is a blaze strong enough to indispose a single man…They say this kind of flame can be borrowed from the Firstborn."

#emph[It is always Elysians with the Faith...]

"How do we convince the griffons to participate in this?"

Boniface rotated the skull he played with, spinning it in his palm. "The Elysians may be heathens, but they understand the most common language to man: gold."

The man was not wrong. In the most farcical of scenarios, Livia and Boniface would request her to carry out this attempt of Claradore’s life. Many had tried. The last assassin had ended his career abruptly, preferring to join the male members of Claradore’s harem upon witnessing the perfection of Claradore’s physique.

In the nave, Serena waved at Nix empty-handed. It would take a full day to bear witness to the success or failure of Nix’ plan.

"I have seen your petition to the Emperor asking for the return of Zastrian’s Cloister to the Faith," Livia said. Boniface’s eyes brightened. They lit up as much as the gold embroidery on his clean white robes.

"When the Firstborn’s flames would have devoured our dear Claradore, would you be interested in reclaiming what is rightfully the Faith’s?"

"A calamity that that building was given to that spider loving cult. Oh! The humanity! How far have the mighty fallen!" said Boniface whose hand dropped the skull by inadvertence before a lightning quick reflex picked it up again.

"Your Grace certainly knows how to read minds. Let the heretics fight among themselves. Let a new age of enlightenment usher for the Medean Empire."

Livia and Nix stared at the skull Boniface held. She had never known men of the Faith to be obsessed by human bones. The Cardinal grinned at both of them.

"Oh this, your Grace? Captivating, isn’t it? It is a memento of my finest hour."

"A memento?" Nix meowed, wanting to ask the same question.

"You have probably heard about the witch I have brought to justice eight years ago. A most revolting person she was. A killer of unborn babes she was at Miroconium. Can you believe it? One who slaughters the most vulnerable of them all? One who denies women the Goddess’ greatest gift: the gift of life in the womb? Justice I have brought to her. I burned her lair and her witch-spawn, cleansing the village of her vile influence." He placed the decorated skull on the altar, its sockets radiating utmost terror. "This, your Grace, are her remains and the evidence that monsters can wear human skin."
