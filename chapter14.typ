In the history books, it would have taken climbing a mountain of skulls to achieve this. The ability to tame fate had been reserved exclusively to the Goddess and the purple born. To them, it was the Heavens’ mandate to forge a better world for their denizens. 

Elysians, Rauthengardians, Cachalots, Medeans, clergymen, courtiers with their varied costumes assembled beneath the imperial throne centered around four fire pots used to clean its dried phoenix feathers. Servants held the plumes with pincers over the brazier, the phoenix’ remains glittering above the flames. 

The phoenix shall always resurrect. Such were the words of the Medean Empire, words that the country has repeated since the collapse of the Tiarmat Empire.

Frescoes detailing the Empire’s past victories against the Donians planked every surface, unwinding before any visitor. The details baffled the eye, from the mail of the Scholae Palatinae to the colored hair of the archers. 
Nix had once touched the painted marble, letting her mind travel through time. From Emperor Marro reuniting the Tiarmat and Medean Empires one last time to the desperate struggle against Molochian hordes, the memories of the elders resurfaced through art. They had always succeeded in rocking Nix within her present hammock, singing songs of bravery and treason.

She and Ralens the Younger had rehearsed the procedure multiple times. The Emperor had to learn how to address his subjects at court, commoners and nobles alike. Somehow Claradore thought it wise for Nix to instruct him on that matter.
Nix had protested that she only served as a mathematics tutor.

"Then you too will learn to navigate the sea of court, my dear," had said Claradore, cryptic as always.

The first man entered the throne room's titanic bronze gates, rows of Excubitores struck the pristine floor with the end of their spear, announcing his coming. Mechanical birds sang. Some were as small as a fist. Others were as large as a melon. When one pulled a string on their back, they would emit the exact same noise as a real life bird. Most of the time, they would be found on the tree of gilt bronze in front of the Emperor’s throne. Another invention used to wow the barbarian emissaries that would waddle in court. Today, Nix asked her pupil to display one that showed a house standing on mushrooms with an old lady in front of it. A young girl was running away from a bear next to the home while carrying what appeared to be a fish in her hands.

The father and the mother, ragged farmers from the capital’s outskirts, came before the Emperor with their son. The child toddled in awe of the grandiose architecture before stopping in front of Ralens the Younger's elevated throne illuminated by the building’s oculus. He charmed the ranks of noblewomen eyeing him with affection. The little one’s pupils loitered around the coffered concrete dome. Above, constellations were mapped via glint stones on the ceiling.

The child stumbled before the two colossal bronze statues of Empress Zenobia and Emperor Charov guarding the way back. Each ruler was three rulers at once or the same people at different times. Their stylized expressions conveyed authority, sorrow and brutality. It was rather impressive how the artisans of the Sarvitarian Empire could carve humanity into these figures.

"I too was impressed like you, little one, by these. Have you seen our collection of statues in the gardens? Emperor Tiarmat wrestling a bull can also help foster your imagination." Nix mused. "How may the crown guide you today, my dear?"

Her hands rested on the throne's right armchair, feeling the soft texture of the thousands of phoenix feathers that constituted the upper layer. The Red Guild always preferred to pull the strings behind the throne and never succumbing to the temptation of sitting on it. While Nix understood the merits of now exposing one to danger, the benefits of being the actual Emperor instead of being the Emperor in name only vastly outweighed the drawbacks. First of all, she could wear all of Livia's sumptuous garments without fear of reprisals. Second of all, there 
was the prestige of making men bow before you. In fact, it was the only position in the Known World where women could have men prostrate themselves before them.

On her right, Ralens wore the imperial diadem, this ensemble of coruscating ruby and purple sapphires. He was enrobed in a purple garb embroidered with flying phoenixes and roaring dragons. Ralens held her hands. His grip was tenuous,
ridden with tremors.  

On her left, Majorian wielded a flute. They were draped in a Scholae Palatinae's breastplate. Underneath the armor, laid a noblewomen's turquoise dress embroidered with flying bats and owls. They sang the ode of the Goddess' Ascension, alternating between a songstress and a male singer with mesmerizing expertise. Nix's skin trembled at every word Majorian pronounced. The farmer, his wife and his child stopped dead in their tracks to listen. With his female voice, Majorian escalated crescendo after crescendo 
, retelling the tale of that poem that lauded the defeat of the last Magi, the Clarans. With each decrescendo with his male voice, Majorian lamented at the slaughter of all Clarans young and old before the Goddess' legions.

Claradore had never appreciated that song, always gritting his teeth ferociously.
The Clarans, he said, were only guilty of existing. Fortunately for Majorian, Claradore had other matters to attend at this hour.

Nix gestured for the farmer and his family to come.

The man lunged forward, shoving his child aside. "Milord, this whore cheated on me for a low life scoundrel. I am divorcing her; the boy belongs to me by right. He is old enough to work on my fields," said the man, his bloodshot eyes darting his bruised wife.

"Your August Majesty, please, I had no choice: I needed money. He spent it all on alcohol and prostitutes."

"Wench! See milord, the whore lies in front of you! You have all the evidence of her debauchery. The boy must be mine!"

"I see the matter relates to the custody of your son. As the divine representative of the Goddess on the mortal plane, I will provide guidance for you. Do you swear by the Goddess you shall respect my decision?" said Ralens in the Classical Tongue. #emph[Flawless discourse,] though Nix. The fruits of laborious nights spent rehearsing this type of answer grew from the throne. Nix picked one, savoring its sour taste.

Both parents acquiesced his words. Ralens turned to Nix.

"Then let’s proceed. You two have proven unable to safeguard your son. The crown shall buy the boy from you to relieve you from this burden. He will work in the palace’s gardens, a starting place for a prosperous career at court, no? Four sheep and two cows for the boy!" Nix announced to the surprised court. She found Serena hiding behind an Excubitore’s purple cloak. Her friend put a finger on her mouth. Mischief would run rampant as her hands wandered around the deep pockets she had access to.

"No, please! He is my child!" begged the mother.

"Seven sheep and five cows," said the father. #emph[Let’s play.]

"Five sheep and three cows," said Nix.

"Stop! Please! You can’t do this! My baby is not for sale!"

"Six sheep and four cows," continued the man.

"Six sheep and four cows for the boy it is!" she proclaimed much to the delight of the father. At the sight of the mother’s utter dismay and the boy’s incomprehension, she beamed a radiant smile none associated with deceit. "You will not fetch this sum. The crown has decided that the boy belongs to his mother. He who sells his children to another is unworthy of parenthood."

A serenade of gasps crossed the court. The farmer’s despair was one she would cherish for the rest of her years.

"Thank you! Thank you! May the True Goddess reward your kindness Your August Majesty!" bowed the woman. Jubilant noblewomen hailed the decision. Serena joined the applause, yelling Nix’ name. "Victory! Victory! Victory! Victory!" they clamored in unison.

Majorian caught up to her in the women's latrines. 

"I did not know you had an affinity for this, my love," said Majorian with a female voice. They planted a kiss on Nix's neck, waves of bliss spreading through her body.

"It is all Claradore's wisdom," answered Nix.

"What about those limitatei that came after the farmers?"

The limitatei. Three border guards had petitioned the Emperor shortly after her triumph with the farmer's boy. They had made the most ludicrous of claims. Monsters in the Exiles' Island. Resisting the temptation to laugh had proven an ordeal for Nix. It was too much. 

"Your August Majesty, village folk have seem them too! They appear at night, preying on lambs and cows. I have seen the wounds. No wolf could have done that,
" had said one of the limitatei with a thick Vyrmogothian accent.

Nix had counseled Ralens to dismiss the men. In all likelihood, the limitatei had 
hallucinated the creatures under a drunken state. Safeguarding the roads of the Empire was after all a dull affair. Report of brigandry had been more than halved since the previous emperor claimed the purple. It was unreasonable to expect the limitatei to abstain from liquor under these conditions.

"Do you not remember when we hid under Livia's bed? The Excubitores have also mentioned the monsters." said Majorian.

"There is no need to access every rumor the throne receives. Do you know how many letters and petitions claim that sucking a man's phallus can cure all diseases? 
You would lose your sanity!"

Majorian laughed. Their lips met again. Majorian touched her hips. They were the only occupants of the room. Perhaps they could...

"I hope I am not interrupting anything," said Serena's voice. Nix and Majorian straightened their posture. Majorian's cheeks were flush with embarrassment.

Serena snatched Nix's hands, pulling her closer to her. Vanilla, heavy with notes of lavender, rosemary and thyme. In fact, Nix knew who this perfume belonged to. Only one woman in the Known World could wear it: the Medean Empress. Serena’s boldness fascinated her. "It was delight, watching you, Phoenix Wing. Don’t you wish for it too? Sitting in the Emperor’s seat?" said Serena.

What was the answer Serena had hoped to acquire? What would Nix tell her? 

"It would look good on me. The crown belongs to those who do not seek it, " Nix simply said to Serena.

"Modesty won't save you from me. I know that you take pleasure in borrowing the princess' clothes. I've seen how your eyes darken with envy each time the Lady Livia enters a room. How the princess hasn't had your head is an enigma of its own."

"She and that fool Domitian haven't the wit between them to fill a thimble."

"I beg to differ. She only tolerates you because she revels in your jealousy."

"Let her enjoy her moment then. All of it will be mine one day."

"Ho! Now you speak treason plain as day, Phoenix Wing. You cannot truly believe you'll sit the Medean throne."

"Claradore and I are Magi. We do not bow to what lesser men call impossible."

"Your father would have been proud of you," said Serena.

#emph[What is that supposed to mean?] thought Nix.

The ringing of mechanical birds brought Nix, Majorian and Serena back to the throne room. The Emperor demanded everyone's presence. The Faith's delegation had come to the Palace Complex.

The colossal bronze gates vaulted open. Columns of Men of the Crucible marched in discord. While military marches followed a strict and discernable tempo, this one was inclined in exhibiting a chaotic choir that would have made any general claw their own eyeballs out of their sockets. Armor that resisted the rules of conformity, beards ridden with bread crumbs and banners that had been degraded by sunlight. Their performance might be risible but their numbers were anything but a laughing matter. For this new Cardinal thought it pertinent to bring an escort of two hundred Men of the Crucible.

The old Cardinal had been nosy, suffice to say. She never understood the point between being a man of The Faith and putting one’s entire slug head in other people’s gardens. It had seemed all those old men did in their spare time was pray or spy on the ordinary of men, plucking petals out of flowers grown by others. Only when the last Cardinal got close to the truth that Claradore asked had tasked her to put him in early retirement.

Today they were introducing to court his new replacement. Someone handpicked by High Cardinal Benedictus and blessed by the Goddess herself. A man by the name of Boniface. Nix wished that boredom defined his character.

For this occasion, Claradore had chosen to arrive nude with his harem of male and female virgins. He laid in a long chair in front of the throne, coiled in his lovers' embrace. The Men of Crucible's visages were all flustered, determined to avoid gazing at Claradore's musculature for the Crimson Spider's phallus was known to be the girthest in Thanatopolis.  

It was only when two white cloaked men vaulted into the throne room in unison that 
she realized that Metarexia sent two not one Cardinals to the imperial capital. 
But why two? The Faith has always needed only one of them at Thanatopolis.

The taller Cardinal hastened his pace. He was an aberration of a human being. At ten imperial feet, even 
the Excubitores felt like dwarves compared to a man of his stature. How could anyone not notice it? Why was the entire court indifferent to this aberration of a man? No one interjected. No one even whispered. This was no human. This was a Giant. A Giant from the Age of Magic. But it could not be. Like their compatriots, the dragons and the Magi, Giants belonged in the Age of Magic. It was Giants who contributed to the Magi's cyclopean structures from upside-down floating pyramids to the opulent libraries of old. Yet none in the court seemed phased by this hulking man. 

The Giant glared at the throne with his tired eyes, eyes that have seen the world wither around them. He was dressed an ill-fitting cloak patterned in silver thread and sewn with singing doves and prancing bulls. He stood at the same height as the bronze statues of Zenobia and Charov.

His hands could easily fit a man's head within their grasp. His arms were as thick as the trunk of small trees. He held a scepter, the handle having being sculpted in the form of a dove, in his left hand. 

Nix watched Claradore's face make a brief grimace at the sight of this man. She quizzed him with a glance, wanting to ascertain that this individual was a Giant. 
Claradore did not return her gaze and quickly reverted to his usual stoical demeanor. 

"Your August Majesty," said the Cardinal as he prostrated himself before Ralens the Younger. His voice was akin to stone rupturing. Even when kneeling, the Giant dwarfed any man.

"Cardinal Sixtus, the Empire welcomes your presence in these trying times," said the Ralens the Younger.

Nix shot a glance at Serena in the crowd of courtiers. Her friend was livid as if she had seen a revenant. Nix struggled to remember the last time Serena's face was drained of color. Fear has never been problematic for someone such as Serena.
In fact, what was terrifying to the non-Magi such as magic astounded her. 
Nix was aware that Serena would be the only non-Magi to charge a live dragon with a smile on her visage.  
Nix believed her eyes lied to her when Serena took one, two, three, four , five, six, seven, eight steps backwards. A man yelped in pain as Serena had visibly stepped on his shoes. Sixtus turned his eyes on her. Nix saw that Serena averted eye contact, running for the latrines instead. Sixtus snarled. 

_What an odd behavior,_ thought Nix. Perhaps Serena's stomach had churned. Only the two Magi, Claradore and Nix, had detected the incongruence in Sixtus' appearance. It was unlikely that Serena could have come to the same conclusions.

The shorter Cardinal moved through the hallways, the surrounding air seemed to condense into ice pellets. Nix froze. She knew this man. His gaze, this predatory seeker riveting anyone from this imaginary seat which he had elevated next to the throne. A vulture in dove’s clothing, peering at the phony confessions it could extract from the average citizen.

"Your Grace, I, Boniface, would be honored to serve you," said a voice Nix recognized. Her heart raced. Poison coated in eloquence. Raspy, emitting drawn-out hissing sounds disguised as politeness. Immutable after all those years. She had remembered its exact intonation, its exact pronunciation of these fateful words. 

"Seize her," he had said eight years ago.

An eloquence that masked its venom, a charisma conjoined with unrivaled zealotry, an intonation that unnerved her right hand which reached for her concealed dagger.

He had aged, wrinkles now covering his forehead yet that self-righteousness, this despicable zealousness, that confidence, all remained intact. She had never forgotten. White cloak on which were drawn rich, resplendent, gold doves ripped straight from one of her old encyclopedias. He always hid with the populace, a leech feeding on his own lies. Yet there he stood now in front of her after all those years. Nix wanted to laugh, for the Man in White has returned.
