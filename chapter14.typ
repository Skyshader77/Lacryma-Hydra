Nix sat on Livia's bed wearing the princess no the empress' crimson cloak which 
absorbed candlelight as if it was spilled wine. A golden brooch shaped like a phoenix clasped the fabric. Livia had worn it once on the day of her majority. Nix' nose found delight in Livia's pine and rose notes. Today she decided to douse her borrowed robe in
the empress' perfume. Wearing these garments granted her the prestige and authority to 
make level-headed decisions. She had to act with the decisiveness of the great military commanders of the Sarvitarian Empire's golden age.

Majorian was still confined to the infirmary. It would take weeks for him to be 
able to walk again. As much as she wanted to continue her escapades with him, 
Nix had more pressing matters to attend to. 

Livia was the Empress and Domitian, the Emperor. Of course, they would find a way to put the blame of Ralens' disappearance on Claradore. They had ordered his arrest but Claradore had more brains than both of them combined. He had fled underground. Nix expected an imminent order from him. For years, the Red Guild drew a web for Ralens the Younger to sit on. The spider would then supervise the phoenix chick. Once the 
phoenix was of age, it would return the favor by burning the dove's domain.

Spartak whimpered next to her. It was right to be scared. There were too many 
uncertainties at the present time. The Hydra had to be dealt with. Ralens had to be 
recovered should he still be alive. And the usurpers must be deposed. 

When one was faced with such a multitude of problems, one was advised to set priorities. Any logical analysis would have yielded that the usurpers posed the greatest threat to her and Claradore. While the Hydra was menacing and could defeat 
a Magi, Livia and Domitian commanded the Medean army and treasury. And Ralens...
Nix had to cling on the faint trace of optimism that he would be alive.

Nix laid her head on Livia's pillow, feeling the beeswax gluing itself on her scalp. 
How to deal with the usurpers? The solution that Claradore would reject was to simply 
burst through the throne room and ignite a dance of blood and flames. She and Spartak 
could cut through the Excurbitores like a hot blade through cheese. But who would sit on the throne of phoenix feathers after the carnage? Claradore? The Medean Empire would be left with a penury of choice. 

"What are you doing in my room?" hissed Livia's voice which was as cold as steel.

Nix bolted upwards. The empress stood before her, clenching a cup of wine. 
She wore the long flowing gown with a mantle of gold 
binding the neckline Nix had often borrowed. The red cape enveloping the attire 
mirrored Livia's flustered visage. 

"Why are you wearing my gown, slave?" said Livia. 

"I was inspecting the integrity of your wardrobe, your August Majesty. Moths may nest inside." said Nix.

It was a bold lie. The empress'face read akin to a death sentence. 

"Moths? Moths? Do you take me for an idiot? Who sent you? Nosrau? Claradore?" said Livia.

"Your brother," said Nix.

"He is dead. We found his corpse."

"You found nothing! He is trapped in the Hydra's den."

Livia raised an eyebrow. "A Hydra? So you are mad on top of being a thief."

"I have seen it, your August Majesty."

"As have the deluded incompetent men we sent in the sewers...Has another plague affected your feeble mind?"

"It feeds on dozens, your August Majesty. Your caches of Medean Fire are needed."

Livia snorted. She crushed the wine cup she was holding. Blood trickled on her well manicured hand. "You think yourself clever, Elysian. You plan to exhaust our stockpiles of 
Medean Fire, so the Emperor of Kings may strike at us. Do not overestimate your intelligence."

Nix saw that Livia's feet made a slow turn towards the room's entrance. Calling the guards would be the empress' next step.

"I am not Nosrau's agent. You and Domitian are in grave danger. The Hydra can strike from any body of water. Baths, fountains, wells can host it," said Nix.

"Unlikely..." Livia's lips drew a cruel smile. "Since your life is already forfeited, 
I'll let you in a secret: our ally commands it."

_What?_ thought Nix.

Livia attempted to sprint towards the door. Nix was faster. She leapt on the empress, pressing her hands on Livia's mouth. Spartak lunged behind the battle, slamming the door shut.
Livia's teeth dug into Nix' fingers. Nix screamed, her mind rejoicing that Livia was not as poisonous as the Hydra.

"Silence! Who commands the Hydra?" said Nix.

No one gave orders to the purple born. Livia's arms and legs flailed trying to claw at 
Nix' nose and eyes. Nix' left arm desperately tried to shield her face from the blows.
She could end this usurper's life now and be remembered as a slayer of kings for the rest of human history.  

The limiting factor was that she needed what Livia knew. How to pry a brain without murdering it? There was of course a way to force a mind to obey another's will. She had already demonstrated that at Baba's house with a fox.
