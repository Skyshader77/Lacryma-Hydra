Her eyes opened themselves. Her body boiled. Toes, fingers, tendons, shoulders, everything ached and burned. Livia had never felt this sensation. Empty air escaped her mouth. #emph[What is going on?];. Help. She had to call a handmaiden. None of her muscles responded. Outside, the moon shone, casting a malefic light on her still body. Livia did not understand. Why couldn’t she move?

Blood. This smell overwhelmed her nose. #emph[Is someone hurt? Am I bleeding?] Yet it was not just blood in the air. An unpalpable, almost undetectable flagrance. Ancient and pernicious through its elusiveness. All of her senses were trying to identify this scent which they should know.

Her back raised itself. Something like a whip lashed at it. She did not give that order. Her fingers cracked themselves. It felt they had doubled in weight. In fact, her entire body seemed to drag this unseen mass or boulder behind it. #emph[What in the Goddess’ name is happening?] Her body brought her hands before her eyes. Her right hand touched her left hand’s palm. A foreign tingling shook her entire being as if it was the first time her body had touched that area. #emph[Stop!] Akin to a petulant child, her hands went to her waist, her shoulders and then her cheeks, pressing their palms against her skin. A tidal wave of unknown sensitivity struck Livia’s nerves. Never had she imagined her own body to be this reactive to her own touch. It did not make any sense.

It was only now that she noticed it. Two. She could hear two heartbeats within her body. One beating faster than Medean war drums and the other...The other followed this unsettling beat, one that had no cadence. One whose frequency would madden the calmest of men. A beat that could only be achieved through unnatural means. Magic? Again, her lungs denied her the opportunity to scream.

Blood. She could taste it. A bulge within her skin coursing through her veins. This mass of red liquid crawling through the second heart, forcing every orifice of her body to accommodate it. The way it moved within her. It had legs. Eight of them. Akin to a termite colony, it could splinter into dozens if not hundreds of broodlings. Legions of them hatched from discarded shells. They scrambled to her lungs, her stomach, her eyes, her heart and her nose. Blood. Blood and a sour black substance poisoned her tongue. She felt them swarm all over. Crawling in every interstice of her organ, foraging for flesh. They seized everything forcing her to do their bidding. If only she could vomit at the thought of that. When they wished, the broodlings could aggregate again into one fell abomination before slithering to her head, her lungs, her legs, petrifying all of her organs.

"It worked..." said Livia’s voice. Livia screeched to no avail, her voice clawing at this invisible barrier.

Her body sauntered out of the bed. It jumped with glee, causing the blood bulge to traverse all of her organs at a nightmarish speed. Her stomach churned . Mucus ran from her nose. Her body nonchalantly wiped it with a finger. Livia wished she could faint right now. #emph[Stop it! Goddess save me from this!]

"It really worked! I...I can’t believe it! Oh! Baba! If only you could see this!"

Her body moved towards the mirror. Dishevelled black hair and a sweat soaked body greeted her red eyes. Red eyes...Red as the Medean phoenix. This could not be… Her eyes were blue. Liva saw her agony within those crimson eyes. Eyes which could peer at the depth of someone’s soul. Eyes which brimmed with fanatical determination through their lust for violence. The Brood Mother. #emph[Goddess help me!]

"Salutations citizens, my name is Livia and I’m as the Goddess’ cunt!" said her voice as her face extended its tongue in a childish manner. The expressions her visage made...They should not be possible. From mischievous grins to devilish laughs, faces both her mother and father would have scolded her for when she was younger. #emph[Please don’t watch this Goddess! I can’t! I don’t know what is going on!]

Screams, attempts to raise her fists. Nothing worked as her own body cackled by itself, deriding her. This had to be dream. Livia had to wake up. Yes, she should be in Domitian’s arms at this moment. This was just some wicked enchantment conjured by pagans such as those Elysians or Molochians merchants. It had to be.

Whatever her body wanted...It gravitated towards her wardrobe. Her eyes were now fixated on that purple cloak that the late Empress Eudoxia once wore during her balls. It was still emblazoned with the Tiarmat hydra. Her fingers ran through the delicate fox hide that comprised the collar of the attire.

"I have always wanted this one," said her voice as her hands scurried to put on the cloak.

Turning to the mirror, her face snickered.

"See it does look better on me."

#emph[Goddess save me! A demon resides within me! What have I done to deserve this?]

The night could not worsen further. Something cawed. A crow with a bald human head appeared on her window. A creature descending straight from beyond the Gates of the Underworld. It sneered at her. Were those teeth even human? Livia did not dare to ask. Impossible. How this monster could exist was beyond the Goddess’ pantheon. The Goddess had ensured mankind that magic was annihilated. Regnant’s entire army purged the Known World of the villainous Magi and their human sacrifices. Nothing made sense in this feverish nightmare. #emph[Domitian will think I am insane for imaginating this!]

"You truly have done it, my dear. How long can you hold?" said the monstrosity.

"You doubt me?" said Livia’s voice.

"That is not the point. There is a reason the Magi had crucified all the people who attempted this... I have seen it myself...The last execution of this kind of miscreant..."

"What are dead men’s rules to the living?"

"The blood mingles with one another, my dear...You should never lose sight of yourself."

"Always with the riddles...Has Baba ever told you how predictable you were?"

#emph[Who is this Baba? Magi? The Goddess liberated this world of the Magi a thousand years ago!]

The bird-thing bit an apple with its human lips. "My dear, even Baba could not possibly envision what you have just done. What are you going to do next?"

Her body placed a finger on her mouth. "Shhh. I just noticed. She can still hear us."

"My my, so the spell has not been perfected yet. What a shame."

"She saw you."

The bird-thing fed flies to cobblewebs on the corner of the window. "Rest assured, my dear. No one will believe her, not even the Emperor himself."

"I’ll exit this, then. We have accomplished what we wanted."

Livia felt her body convulse. She crumbled to the ground, shaking with increasing folly. She screamed, this time sound erupting from her vocal chords. #emph[Free! I am free!] Her eyes teared up as a grotesque bulge was forming on her throat. It began as small as a pear. A searing pain consumed her neck as more and more blood flowed towards the horrible protrusion, swelling it to the size of a melon. #emph[I can’t breathe.]

In a single instant, she retched a putrid mass of blood. For ten long agonizing seconds, Livia expelled liters if not gallons of foul liquid from herself. The taste. It felt she tasted every member of the human body concentrated in a vile juice. Never had she gagged as much as she did. Her eyes fluttered. The last thing they saw was the bird-thing departing from her window. Her world went black.

"My Lady is all right? I heard screaming," asked the Elysian dancer at her door.

Livia shot up from her bed, frantically reaching for anything she could use as a weapon. Her body was drenched in urine and sweat. She could hear her own frenzied breathing.

#emph[What? Was this all a dream?]

The Elysian. Livia has always found that attire ridiculous. Fully clothed in thick red tunic from head to shoes, a full demonstration of Claradore’s eccentricities. How that girl was supposed to endure the summer heat was beyond Livia’s comprehension. The girl’s eyes though...While Elysian women all looked the same, this one...There was something about her.

The Elysians...They had strayed away from The Faith, the worst decision someone could have made. The inability to cross the Gates of Hel...Stranded on the other side, unable to join in your loved ones the afterlife...Oh, if only she could save them...

#emph[Elysians. The gryphons of the desert. Our country’s sworn rival. Why did it have to be this way?]

Livia asked for a bath to be prepared. Somehow, the Elysian dancer already anticipated her request. It was then that Livia recognized her face. She was that puppeteer from earlier and her brother’s tutor. She must have fornicated with Claradore to attain this position. There is no other way. Her name could have been Bix...Rix...Tix...Nix...Pix...probably Mix.

"I have had the worst nightmare to date. Let the Magister Herbarum know about it," said Livia.

"Princess, I am again sorry such vile omens plague you, I shall fetch Claradore," said Mix.

"Tell me before you go...Does magic still exist in the Elysian Empire?"

Mix raised an eyebrow. "I do not understand the question, Princess. Everyone knows magic has been extinct for more than a thousand years."

"That cannot be true...My dreams...You cannot comprehend what I have dreamed of."

Mix placed her hand over Livia’s. Glacial. How the Elysian’s touch could be colder than snow? The human body could not be that frigid. "Princess, you should rest easy. Know that should magic truly return, the Faith, the Barbarian Kingdoms, Elysian and Medean Empires, no the Known World, would be in a torrent of unadulterated pain."
