Nix sat on Livia's bed wearing the princess no the empress' crimson cloak which 
absorbed candlelight as if it was spilled wine. A golden brooch shaped like a phoenix clasped the fabric. Livia had worn it once on the day of her majority. Nix' nose found delight in Livia's pine and rose notes. Today she decided to douse her borrowed robe in
the empress' perfume. Wearing these garments granted her the prestige and authority to 
make level-headed decisions. She had to act with the decisiveness of the great military commanders of the Sarvitarian Empire's golden age.

Majorian was still confined to the infirmary. It would take weeks for him to be 
able to walk again. As much as she wanted to continue her escapades with him, 
Nix had more pressing matters to attend to. 

Livia was the Empress and Domitian, the Emperor. Of course, they would find a way to put the blame of Ralens' disappearance on Claradore. They had ordered his arrest but Claradore had more brains than both of them combined. He had fled underground. Nix expected an imminent order from him. For years, the Red Guild drew a web for Ralens the Younger to sit on. The spider would then supervise the phoenix chick. Once the 
phoenix was of age, it would return the favor by burning the dove's domain.

Spartak whimpered next to her. It was right to be scared. There were too many 
uncertainties at the present time. The Hydra had to be dealt with. Ralens had to be 
recovered should he still be alive. And the usurpers must be deposed. 

When one was faced with such a multitude of problems, one was advised to set priorities. Any logical analysis would have yielded that the usurpers posed the greatest threat to her and Claradore. While the Hydra was menacing and could defeat 
a Magi, Livia and Domitian commanded the Medean army and treasury. And Ralens...
Nix had to cling on the faint trace of optimism that he would be alive.

Nix laid her head on Livia's pillow, feeling the beeswax gluing itself on her scalp. 
How to deal with the usurpers? The solution that Claradore would reject was to simply 
burst through the throne room and ignite a dance of blood and flames. She and Spartak 
could cut through the Excurbitores like a hot blade through cheese. But who would sit on the throne of phoenix feathers after the carnage? Claradore? The Medean Empire would be left with a penury of choice. 

"What are you doing in my room?" hissed Livia's voice which was as cold as steel.

Nix bolted upwards. The empress stood before her, clenching a cup of wine. 
She wore the long flowing gown with a mantle of gold 
binding the neckline Nix had often borrowed. The red cape enveloping the attire 
mirrored Livia's flustered visage. 

"Why are you wearing my gown, slave?" said Livia. 

"I was inspecting the integrity of your wardrobe, your August Majesty. Moths may nest inside." said Nix.

It was a bold lie. The empress'face read akin to a death sentence. 

"Moths? Moths? Do you take me for an idiot? Who sent you? Nosrau? Claradore?" said Livia.

"Your brother," said Nix.

"He is dead. We found his corpse."

"You found nothing! He is trapped in the Hydra's den."

Livia raised an eyebrow. "A Hydra? So you are mad on top of being a thief."

"I have seen it, your August Majesty."

"As have the deluded incompetent men we sent in the sewers...Has another plague affected your feeble mind?"

"It feeds on dozens, your August Majesty. Your caches of Medean Fire are needed."

Livia snorted. She crushed the wine cup she was holding. Blood trickled on her well manicured hand. "You think yourself clever, Elysian. You plan to exhaust our stockpiles of 
Medean Fire, so the Emperor of Kings may strike at us. Do not overestimate your intelligence."

Nix saw that Livia's feet made a slow turn towards the room's entrance. Calling the guards would be the empress' next step.

"I am not Nosrau's agent. You and Domitian are in grave danger. The Hydra can strike from any body of water. Baths, fountains, wells can host it," said Nix.

"Unlikely..." Livia's lips drew a cruel smile. "Since your life is already forfeited, 
I'll let you in a secret: our ally commands it."

_What?_ thought Nix.

Livia attempted to sprint towards the door. Nix was faster. She leapt on the empress, pressing her hands on Livia's mouth. Spartak lunged behind the battle, slamming the door shut.
Livia's teeth dug into Nix' fingers. Nix screamed, her mind rejoicing that Livia was not as poisonous as the Hydra.

"Silence! Who commands the Hydra?" said Nix. A muffled curse was her answer.

No one gave orders to the purple born. Livia's arms and legs flailed trying to claw at 
Nix' nose and eyes. Nix' left arm desperately tried to shield her face from the blows.
She could end this usurper's life now and be remembered as a slayer of kings for the rest of human history.  

The limiting factor was that she needed what Livia knew. How to pry a brain without murdering it? The Red Guild was well versed in the art of torture. As pleasurable as that art was, having a purple born without a limb or two could constitute a problem. 
There was of course another way to force a mind to obey another's will. She had already demonstrated that at Baba's house with a fox.

Nix melted her right hand. Her blood flowed through Livia's mouth, touching the princess's tongue. She felt Livia's teeth attempt to bite her liquefied form. Humans fought where animals did not resist. She did not understand and she did not want to. Nix would not be deterred. 
Nix' torso, legs and feet followed her right hand. She felt her head melt before entering the mouth, fighting the princess' gag reflex. Such an act was sacrilege for the Magi but did it matter? A screen of velvet curtains descended before her vision which saw Livia's throat, esophagus and heart scroll before her cascading form. 

#align(center)[⁂]

Livia's eyes opened themselves. Her body boiled. Toes, fingers, tendons, shoulders, everything ached and burned. Livia had never felt this sensation. Empty air escaped her mouth. #emph[What is going on?];. Help. She had to call a handmaiden. None of her muscles responded. Outside, the moon shone, casting a malefic light on her still body. Livia did not understand. Why couldn’t she move?

The last thing she remembered was the deranged handmaiden that dared to wound her. 
Death was too kind for that one. For all Livia knew, her assailant 
was an Elysian spy.

Blood. This smell overwhelmed her nose. #emph[Is someone hurt? Am I bleeding?] Yet it was not just blood in the air. An unpalpable, almost undetectable flagrance. Ancient and pernicious through its elusiveness. All of her senses were trying to identify this scent which they should know.

Her back raised itself. Something like a whip lashed at it. She did not give that order. Her fingers cracked themselves. It felt they had doubled in weight. In fact, her entire body seemed to drag this unseen mass or boulder behind it. #emph[What in the Goddess’ name is happening?] Her body brought her hands before her eyes. Her right hand touched her left hand’s palm. A foreign tingling shook her entire being as if it was the first time her body had touched that area. #emph[Stop!] Akin to a petulant child, her hands went to her waist, her shoulders and then her cheeks, pressing their palms against her skin. A tidal wave of unknown sensitivity struck Livia’s nerves. Never had she imagined her own body to be this reactive to her own touch. It did not make any sense.

It was only now that she noticed it. Two. She could hear two heartbeats within her body. One beating faster than Medean war drums and the other...The other followed this unsettling beat, one that had no cadence. One whose frequency would madden the calmest of men. A beat that could only be achieved through unnatural means. Magic? Again, her lungs denied her the opportunity to scream.

Blood. She could taste it. A bulge within her skin coursing through her veins. This mass of red liquid crawling through the second heart, forcing every orifice of her body to accommodate it. The way it moved within her. It had legs. Eight of them. Akin to a termite colony, it could splinter into dozens if not hundreds of broodlings. Legions of them hatched from discarded shells. They scrambled to her lungs, her stomach, her eyes, her heart and her nose. Blood. Blood and a sour black substance poisoned her tongue. She felt them swarm all over. Crawling in every interstice of her organ, foraging for flesh. They seized everything forcing her to do their bidding. If only she could vomit at the thought of that. When they wished, the broodlings could aggregate again into one fell abomination before slithering to her head, her lungs, her legs, petrifying all of her organs.

"It worked..." said Livia’s voice. Livia screeched to no avail, her voice clawing at this invisible barrier.

Her body sauntered out of the bed. It jumped with glee, causing the blood bulge to traverse all of her organs at a nightmarish speed. Her stomach churned . Mucus ran from her nose. Her body nonchalantly wiped it with a finger. Livia wished she could faint right now. #emph[Stop it! Goddess save me from this!]

"It really worked! I...I can’t believe it! Oh! Baba! If only you could see this!"

Her body moved towards the mirror. Dishevelled black hair and a sweat soaked body greeted her red eyes. Red eyes...Red as the Medean phoenix. This could not be… Her eyes were blue. Liva saw her agony within those crimson eyes. Eyes which could peer at the depth of someone’s soul. Eyes which brimmed with fanatical determination through their lust for violence. The Brood Mother. #emph[Goddess help me!]

"Salutations citizens, my name is Livia and I’m as the Goddess’ cunt!" said her voice as her face extended its tongue in a childish manner. The expressions her visage made...They should not be possible. From mischievous grins to devilish laughs, faces both her mother and father would have scolded her for when she was younger. #emph[Please don’t watch this Goddess! I can’t! I don’t know what is going on!]

Screams, attempts to raise her fists. Nothing worked as her own body cackled by itself, deriding her. This had to be dream. Livia had to wake up. Yes, she should be in Domitian’s arms at this moment. This was just some wicked enchantment conjured by pagans such as those Elysians or Molochians merchants. It had to be.

Whatever her body wanted...It gravitated towards her wardrobe. Her eyes were now fixated on that purple cloak that the late Empress Eudoxia once wore during her balls. It was still emblazoned with the Tiarmat hydra. Her fingers ran through the delicate fox hide that comprised the collar of the attire.

"I have always wanted this one," said her voice as her hands scurried to put on the cloak.

Turning to the mirror, her face snickered.

"See it does look better on me."

#emph[Goddess save me! A demon resides within me! What have I done to deserve this?]

The night could not worsen further. Something cawed. A crow with a bald human head appeared on her window. A creature descending straight from beyond the Gates of the Underworld. It sneered at her. Were those teeth even human? Livia did not dare to ask. Impossible. How this monster could exist was beyond the Goddess’ pantheon. The Goddess had ensured mankind that magic was annihilated. Regnant’s entire army purged the Known World of the villainous Magi and their human sacrifices. Nothing made sense in this feverish nightmare. #emph[Domitian will think I am insane for imaginating this!]

"You truly have done it, my dear. How long can you hold?" said the monstrosity.

"You doubt me?" said Livia’s voice.

"That is not the point. There is a reason the Magi had crucified all the people who attempted this... I have seen it myself...The last execution of this kind of miscreant..."

"What are dead men’s rules to the living?"

"The blood mingles with one another, my dear...You should never lose sight of yourself."

"Always with the riddles...Has Baba ever told you how predictable you were?"

#emph[Who is this Baba? Magi? The Goddess liberated this world of the Magi a thousand years ago!]

The bird-thing bit an apple with its human lips. "My dear, even Baba could not possibly envision what you have just done. What are you going to do next?"

"There is a Hydra dwelling underneath of us."

"I am aware."

"And you have never told me?"

"I did not think the Emperor would care for it."

"And yet the Hydra took the Emperor. He may have crossed the Gates of the Underworld already."

"The Emperor lives."

Livia felt one of her eyebrows arch.

"How?" said the demon wearing her skin.

"The Hydra needs him. He is bait for us Magi."

"So it grants us time."

"Time we should exploit to its fullest, my dear."

Her body placed a finger on her mouth. "Quiet. She hears us still.."

"My, my, so the spell has not been perfected yet. What a shame."

"I will rectify this mistake."

Livia felt her body convulse. She crumbled to the ground, shaking with increasing folly. She screamed, this time sound erupting from her vocal chords. #emph[Free! I am free!] Her eyes teared up as a grotesque swell was forming on
her left cheek. It had the texture of a foul egg. A human face hatched from it. It was the handmaiden that assaulted her, the one who had the gall of wearing her clothes.
The second visage, this cancerous spawn that desecrated her flesh, sneered.

"We meet again, Empress."

"You! Get out of me!"

"It is time for you to sleep, Empress, permanently," said the handmaiden.

"What do you want, fiend?"

"Have you not guessed it? Your will must follow mine."

"You repulsive thing, you cannot claim to control me," said Livia.

The vile bulge disappeared, but another formed within her throat. It began as small as a pear. A searing pain consumed her neck as more and more blood flowed towards the horrible protrusion, swelling it to the size of a melon. #emph[I can’t breathe.]. The taste. It felt she tasted every member of the human body concentrated in a vile juice. Never had she gagged as much as she did. Her eyes fluttered. The last thing they saw was the bird-thing departing from her window. Her world went black.
