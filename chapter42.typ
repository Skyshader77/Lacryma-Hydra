Livia walked around her room. To think her brother would commit to the 
unthinkable. The time had not come for him to be a match for Alexander in the magical arts. The Palace Complex had yet to be made aware of his disappearance.
All the blame would be directed towards the Faith.

She struck the vanity mirror with her fist. Blood leaked from her fingers. It was the same color as the velvet and obsidian dress she was draped in. Livia gobbled 
her pint of red Vyrmogothian wine, her fifth of the day. His disobedience would not go unpunished. Or should it? All he had done since the beginning of their reign was to add unpredictability to a volatile situation. Her inner calculations did not need another variable. _Maybe all could be simplified,_ thought Livia.

The thing called Majorian wept. Its sword like claws were aimed at her throat. 
She stood there, mocking its conviction. Its weapons screamed for murder, yet its face signalled mercy. It was plain as day. Livia sipped her cup of wine.

"Tell me, what is your name?" it said.

Nix loathed that question. It was an accusation not a question. Has she not demonstrated her worthiness of her station? Why could he not see? It was because it hearkened to a distant past. In fact, Majorian lived in the past, wallowing in nostalgia. What was it with humans and their obsession for the past? In trapping one's self in a previous state of existence, one failed to see the future. Anything was bleak to someone who refused to see past their childhood. By the time an adult reached adulthood, they were acutely aware of misery and hardship. Except that they now wielded the will and power to grant themselves to better their tomorrow.

Majorian's growl returned her attention to the matter at hand. So it was the Cardinal's contingency. Would it matter?
In a matter of hours, the greatest gamble of her life would unfold.

"I tire of simple questions," Livia said.

"It is not a simple question. What is your name?" said Majorian.

"Livia."

"You lie."

Lie? She has always told it the truth. What has possessed it? Was it losing its sanity in its monstrous form? She should have granted it mercy when she had the opportunity.

"Then, tell me what is my name if it is not Livia?" said Livia.

"You are Nix."

The words sent chills down her spire. She cracked her fingers. Livia has not heard that name in months. She was all but Livia in flesh and soul. Magic had enhanced her being beyond recognition. 

Livia played with her glass of wine. "That name is unknown to me," said Livia.

"You lie again. You have only borrowed the name Livia. You are Nix, daughter of Nosrau. Have you forgotten? Has your reason for existing been erased?"

She threw her glass at it. Shattering glass pealed through the room's silence. 

"I exist to rule this Empire."

It pressed its weight against her. Its claws touched her cheek with this foreign delicateness. Was it lust she saw in its amber eyes? An advantage, perhaps. It had overextended its welcome. The guards would come.

"Do you remember the night we spent here? I wore this dress," said Livia with Nix's voice.

"Nix...My love..." said Majorian. In the end, monster or not, it was as naive and deluded as a Faithful. 

She brought her lips closer to its fiendish visage. 
"Should we? The most beautiful body in the Empire could be yours for the night. We can play...I'll be the Empress this time...You...Domitian..."

"No, Nix, no more games, return to me. Leave the princess' body. Her life is not yours to take," said Majorian.

She slapped it. Again and again. How stubborn could it be? Livia would order all Excubitores to remove all mentions of the name Nix from the imperial archives. Poeple must forget. From now on, the name Nix must be associated with oblivion.

"Do not call me by that old name. I am the Empress of the Medean Empire. You will address me as such..." She licked her lips. "Fiend." Its face contorted into pain.

"You have truly lost your way. Doesn't her screams keep you awake at night? Don't they bring you to the precipice of insanity?" said Majorian.

Livia shook her head. Her other self glowed within the medallion. "She does not comprehend that I have brought her life to greater heights," said Livia.

"Enhanced her life? Do you even listen to yourself? All you have done is deceit. You have used her voice to assassinate her fiance. You used her form to fornicate with Ordogan. You slip poison in her brother's ears. You steel this nation for war. Have you not considered their extreme anguish when they realize the truth?"

"The truth you say? The truth is that I have always been Livia. Royal blood courses through me. Elysian and Medean. I am the heiress to both empires. Never will I not see the day that I am not saluted as an Empress."

Majorian raised their claws. 

"I will not repeat myself. You will leave this body at once."

Livia opened her arms. "There is only one way for me to exit this costume. Strike it if you will but the other me dies with me as well."

"Have you no honor?"

"There is no honor when crossing steel with fiends and Cardinals."

Majorian swiped. Livia closed her eyes. It would not dare. It had never taken the life of an innocent. Why should that change now? She felt its claws grate against her cheek. Blood trickled. Her heart still beat. There was no pain. When she opened her eyes, the claw was lodged in a fresco depicting the Goddess' final departure from the land of the living. Majorian had perforated the Goddess' head.

"You are weak...You have never killed," said Livia. Majorian had always been her doll. Toys could not harm her.

Majorian's face was inundated with tears. It swore.

"The Goddess take you, Nix!" it rasped, its claws shredding the frescoes.

"The Goddess cannot harm me. She is dead," said Livia.

The clattering of boots interrupted their conversation. Ordogan and five Excubitores, clad in chain mail, stormed the room. The thing called Majorian shrieked.

"Foul creature, begone from this room!" roared Ordogan. Livia unsheathed her hidden dagger.

Ordogan shot an arrow. Majorian shielded itself with its wings, the arrow still penetrating its hide. It yelled in pain. An Excubitore thrust forward with his lance. Majorian stumbled, toppling Livia's arsenal of cosmetics. Yet there was no easy victory against a Magrub Doga. Claws serrated shields and armor. Monster and human blood splattered on her arsenal of dresses.

"My Lady, run!" screamed Ordogan. It was in these times that he forgot that he was her subordinate. One does not give orders to an empress.

"Men of the Empire, you must listen! Your Empress..." screamed Majorian.

"Despicable! It can imitate human speech! Do not try to deceive us trickery!"
said Livia.

"She lieeees! She liiiees!"

Ordogan and the Excubitores kept dealing blow after blow. 
She saw an opening amidst their movements constrained by their heavy armor. Livia side stepped towards Majorian, inserting her blade into their throat. There was no resistance, only blood. The thing called Majorian dropped on the mosaic floor. It gargled blood. Crawling on the floor, its hands tried to reach for Livia. It repeated her name over and over. Ordogan impaled its head with his spear.
