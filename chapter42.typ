The thing called Majorian wept. Its sword like claws were aimed at her throat. 
She stood there, mocking its conviction. Its weapons screamed for murder, yet its face signalled mercy. It was plain as day. Livia sipped her cup of wine.

"Nix, return to me. Leave the princess' body. Her life is not yours to take,"
said Majorian.

"Do not call me by that old name. I am the Empress of the Medean Empire. You will address me as such..." She licked her lips. "Fiend." Its face contorted into pain.

"You have truly lost your way. Doesn't her screams keep you awake at night? Don't they bring you to the precipice of insanity?" said Majorian.

Livia shook her head. "She does not comprehend that I have enhanced her life," said Livia.

"Enhanced her life? Do you even listen to yourself? You have used her voice to assassinate her fiance. You used her form to fornicate with Ordogan. Have you not considered their extreme anguish when they realize the truth?"

"The truth you say? The truth is that I have always been Livia. Royal blood courses through me. Elysian and Medean. I am the heiress to both empires. Never will I not see the day that I am not saluted as an Empress."

Majorian raised their claws. 

"I will not repeat myself. You will leave this body at once."

Livia opened her arms. "There is only one way for me to exit this costume. Strike it if you will but the other me dies with me as well."

"Have you no honor?"

"There is no honor when crossing steel with fiends and Cardinals."

Majorian swiped. Livia closed her eyes. It would not dare. It had never taken the life of an innocent. Why should that change now? She felt its claws grate against her cheek. Blood trickled. Her heart still beat. There was no pain. When she opened her eyes, the claw was lodged in a fresco depicting the Goddess' final departure from the land of the living. Majorian had perforated the Goddess' head.

Majorian's face was inundated with tears. It swore.

"The Goddess take you, Nix!" it rasped.

"She cannot. She is dead," said Livia.

The clattering of boots interrupted their conversation. Ordogan and five Excubitores stormed the room. The thing called Majorian shrieked.

"Foul creature, begone from this room!" roared Ordogan. Livia unsheathed her hidden dagger.

Ordogan shot an arrow. Majorian shielded itself with its wings, the arrow still penetrating its hide. It yelled in pain. An Excubitore thrust forward with his lance. Majorian stumbled, toppling Livia's arsenal of cosmetics. Yet there was no easy victory against a Magrub Doga. Claws serrated shields and armor. Monster and human blood splattered on her arsenal of dresses.

"My Lady, run!" screamed Ordogan. It was in these times that he forgot that he was her subordinate.

"Men of the Empire, you must listen! Your Empress..." screamed Majorian.

"Despicable. It can imitate human speech! Do not try to deceive us trickery!"
said Livia.

"She lieeees! She liiiees!"

Ordogan and the Excubitores kept dealing blow after blow. She saw an opening amidst their movements constrained by their heavy armor. Livia side stepped towards Majorian, inserting her blade into their throat. There was no resistance, only blood. The thing called Majorian dropped on the mosaic floor. It gargled blood. Crawling on the floor, its hands tried to reach for Livia. It repeated her name over and over. Ordogan impaled its head with his spear.
