"Wake up! Wake up!" Baba said. Nix groaned. An orange light flared in her room, lighting Baba’s worried face. Nix had never seen her as alarmed as she was.

"What is going on?" asked Nix.

"Get dressed and stay in the house no matter what. Do not go outside, " said Baba as she snuffed the candles.

"I don-t..."

Baba hugged her with such intensity that Nix’s bones could have snapped. #emph[I can’t breathe.] The tender touch that patted her back every night returned. Nix did not understand. #emph[What is going on? Why did you wake me up just to hug me?]

"Do you love me?" said Baba, her blue and brown eyes as luminous as a child’s.

"O-O-Of course!" said Nix. Baba’s teeth made the prettiest smile Nix had ever witnessed. To see Baba so happy made her night.

"I’ve never told you about your mother now did I?"

"I don’t need a mother! I have you!"

"I am glad, my gold coin." She dropped something in Nix’ hands, a medallion. Dried blood covered a silver griffon. Actual silver. Nix assumed the ornament was as expensive as the entirety of Baba’s possessions. The writing on it, a tongue Nix did not recognize. She rotated the medallion to find a keyhole.

"It is written in the Elysian Tongue. Perhaps if you go to the Elysian Empire you will find answers on how to open it," said Baba.

"I don’t want to go the Elysian Empire! I want to stay here with you! You told me we would go to Thanatopolis next year!"

Baba made the same expression as Spartak when it got injured. #emph[Did I do anything wrong?] She gave Nix another hug, this one more passionate than the other. A hug that wanted to be reassuring through its desperation. Nix had never received this type of hug. She had expected Baba’s embrace to bring this warmth and this courage that guided her against the monsters which hid under her bed. Cold. The word was insufficient to describe this hug. Nix’ hair was raised. The temperature in the house had dropped by at least ten degrees. Had winter come this early this year? "Thank you, my gold coin. I love you too. Please, please hide in the house before I come back," said Baba, her voice cracking.

"This is bizarre, Baba. What is going on?"

"OPEN THE DOOR!" screamed a man’s voice coming from the kitchen. Infernal knocks were heard, each pounding the wooden door with the aggressivity of a mad boar. Shoes and boots stomped the premises of Baba’s abode.

"I am coming," said Baba. Nix sensed that Baba was struggling to form that sentence.

"I’ll come with you! I need to get Spartak," said Nix.

"NO! YOU HAVE TO HIDE! STAY HERE AND DO NOT UTTER A SINGLE WORD. AM I CLEAR?" Baba screamed with the ferocity of the mother bear. In that instant, she commanded Nix’s full obedience. In that moment, even the Medean Emperor could have bowed before her.

Nix wrapped herself in her drapes while Baba headed downstairs. Peering through the window, she saw an army of torches arrayed in front of the door. The Faith’s dove banners were flown by Men of the Crucible or monks dressed up in soldiers’ gear as Baba loved to call them. Men and women, their pupils glowing in the tranquil darkness, all armed with pitchforks and clubs. All looked at the door with the same intent as the mother bear. The girl Nix and Baba helped stood next to a man dressed in a formal attire. #emph[What was her name again? I forgot.] Bruises and dried tears had found their way into her face which Nix could relate to. She had made the same expression when seeing the mother bear. That man. Nix had only seen his costume in encyclopedias relating to the Faith. Gold embroidery glittered under his torch. Unlike the other men, the Man in White remained calm and composed, his lips singing the Faith’s hymns. Men of the Crucible flanked him, reciting verses of the Gospel. The pungent smell of incense invaded the air, as if Nix had stepped inside one the Faith’s churches. #emph[A prince or a cardinal?]

"I am here, what do you want," said Baba as she opened the door.

"WITCH! BABE KILLER! MAY YOU ROT IN HELL!" screamed a man. The other humans repeated the words in synchrony. Another spat at Baba’s face. #emph[What are they talking about? Baba is not a witch.]

"You people certainly know how to make friends," said Baba while wiping the saliva from her nose.

"You do not have the luxury for sarcasm, witch. Do you have any idea what sacrilege you have committed? An affront to the Goddess on MY holy land?" said the Man in White.

"Sacrilege? Everything is heresy to you Faithful! What I am accused of this time? Of shitting in my own toilet? Feeding my cows? Wearing a skirt? I do not have the time to entertain you lot. If you have any complaints, tell your Emperor, what was his name again? Ah Vitiatus! Tell Emperor Vitiatus, he owes me his life! That brat wouldn’t be on the throne if I hadn’t nursed him!"

"You are mad as they say. Emperor Vitiatus? That was two hundred years ago, witch! What kind of demon has possessed you to believe you saved a dead man?"

"She is a witch, Father, you have the evidence, burn her!" implored a Man of the Crucible, his eyes reddening like a rabid wolf.

"WITCH! BABE KILLER! DEATH! DEATH! DEATH!" echoed the crowd as they banged their pitchforks on the ground.

"SILENCE! We are not the savage Molochians but civilized beings, fellow citizens. What would we be without our morals and standards?" said the Man in White. The men and women stayed silent, looking at the Man in White the same way Nix looked at her favorite book. "Yes, we are the Faithful, the paragons of justice and goodness in the Known World, the harbringers of civilization, the light that shines through the eternal darkness, are we not? It is our responsibility, is it not? To show this witch the goodness of the Goddess, we shall grant her a fair trial. Let the Goddess decide if she is guilty!" said the Man in White. Nix sighed. The crowd exploded in frenzied applause, showering the apostle with incomprehensible praise and with prayers. "Seize her."

Two Men of the Crucible grabbed Baba’s wrists with their bronze gauntlets. Baba attempted to bite one of them only to be jabbed in the stomach. Nix gasped, shuddering under her drapes. #emph[Should I do something...What should I do? What can I do? But Baba told her to hide.] Nothing could bring her warmth. Everything froze when she touched it. She heard her own heart’s pulses animated by a folly, one which caused her legs to shake faster than a woodpecker’s pecks. #emph[Leave us alone! We didn’t do anything wrong!]

"In accordance to the fairest of all trials, The Goddess asks us to bring forth a witness to this witch’s crimes. The Goddess be exalted! Today we are blessed by Her Eminence: a witness has agreed to testify against this vile fiend... Come, girl," said the Man in White to the girl Nix and Baba helped.

Nix saw that Baba glared at the girl, her eyes making this sort of silent accusation Nix had only seen when she had made a terrible mistake.

"Girl, have you truly witnessed it? This witch, has she murdered an unborn babe in front of your very eyes," said the Man in White, a wide grin creeping up on his face.

"It is true, Father," said the girl. The crowd uttered gasps of disapproval, raising their pitchforks. They hurled profanities at Baba, more spat at her. A Man of the Crucible struck Baba’s face. #emph[Stop it please!]

"Do you swear it? In the name of the Goddess who gave birth to us all?"

"I swear it, by the Goddess."

The crowd’s insults grew louder and louder. Their mouths appeared to transform, bringing forth sharp and elongated teeth craving for blood. Bloodshot eyes gazed hungrily at Baba. The Men of the Crucible now looked like metallic hounds released from the far depths of the Underworld. Nix waited for the moment she would wake up to find herself in Baba’s arms again. There were too many monsters in this nightmare and she was afraid.

"Guilty! GUILTY, my most pious citizens, is the Goddess’ verdict! In all her wiseness, the Goddess has proclaimed this accursed witch guilty of murdering a babe in cold blood. Oh! The humanity! To think that a serial killer was living in our peaceful community! One that slaughters children! CHILDREN! CHILDREN! The most vulnerable of all! What is more important than the sanctity of a child’s life? Oh! Goddess! Children of the Faith, we cannot possibly let such a monster live in our faithful community, can we? No, no, no, you are all as intelligent as the Goddess wanted you to be. I hereby offer this witch the death penalty as the harshest and fairest punishment for her deeds," said the Man in White

"What about the witch-spawn, milord? An Elysian. She lives inside the house. As far I know, she is capable of witchcraft too," said the girl. Nix stopped looking through the window. #emph[What do I do now?]

"NO! NO! NO! DON’T YOU DARE! It is me you want, not her! Grant her the dignity of life!" screamed Baba, her nails attempting to claw away at her captors. A stick was inserted into her mouth to silence her.

"Burn the house, let the witch-spawn join her corruptor in Hell. Mercy for the child tainted by paganism," said the Man in White.

Baba hollered horrible bawls as they tied her to a tree. The girl pelted her forehead with a stone. Men of the Crucible landed blow after blow on Baba’s head. The sound of bones snapping. Nix shut her ears as she sprinted to the front door. She had to save Baba and Spartak. Nix went down the familiar spiral stairs, knowing that the third step had always been uneven. The marinated chicken Baba put on the kitchen table watched her try to unlock the door only to encounter a perverse resistance. #emph[It’s jammed from the outside.] Nix banged it incessantly, screeching with deafening intensity. She had to save Baba. Smoke. There was smoke. Torches were flung at the house, the flames they ignited devouring the roof. She had to save Baba. Nix kept on hitting the door with her hands, feet, back, head. It would not budge. Above, a black mist consumed the chimney where Baba had taught her how to light a fire with magic. The flames consumed Baba’s portrait in the living room, one that portrayed her marriage when the Sarvatarian Empire was still whole. Nix’ hands and feet bled. Outside, Baba wailed when Nix heard projectiles hitting her body.

Behind Nix, the stairs she had came by disintegrated in a trail of ashes. Her bunk bed covered in soot crashed into the kitchen. The pillow she needed to fend off the darkness. Gone. The tunics Baba had knit for her in eight different colors. Turned into black powder. She inhaled the smoke, coughing at the destruction of what she had called home. Home, a thing some children in fairy tales did not possess. She had been lucky to have a place she had called home. Nix wept and wept as she kept battering the locked door with her wounded body parts. What was she to do? Her true mother’s medallion laid on the broken floor.

#emph[No! Please! This is too cruel.] If she could save Baba, they could rebuild it. They would run. Far. Far away from the Man in White. Maybe near Thanatopolis where they could build a bigger house with a room for Spartak. She had to save Baba.

A blazing beam fell on her leg. Her upper body rolled in pain as the flames seared her flesh. The smell of burning skin and blood flooded her nose alongside the already overwhelming smoke. Her tongue tasted blood. #emph[So that is how death smells like];. The sealed door stood before her. Impregnable, indestructible, undefeatable, condemning her to suffocate in the place where she had felt the safest. Nix hit it one last time to no avail. #emph[Baba...I’m sorry.] Her eyes closed, resigning themselves to eternal slumber.

In her sleep, she felt someone grab her. Her eyesight fluttered, seeing a man burst through the door, a tarantula tattooed on his chest. Baba’s body hung on the Hollow Tree, lifeless tears drying out on her maimed face. Perhaps Nix was waking up from the nightmare.

"If only I could have come sooner. Destiny has its own strange way of reuniting both of us, my dear Nix," her savior said. She glanced at him using the last ounce of strength she had left. Eyes that fit the description of a fairy tale prince. A stout body that could match the most proud of bulls. And the spider tattoo, an exact replica of Claradore’s artstyle. The resemblance was uncanny if not lacked subtility.

"Baba..." she croaked.

"I’m sorry...We shall both mourn her, my dear," he said.
