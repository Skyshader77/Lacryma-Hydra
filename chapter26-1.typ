Her red eyes looked in a mirror. Her skin was the same color 
as warm milk, a notable difference from her usual tanned skin. 
Dishevelled hair fell over her eyes.
Someone could have mistaken her for a war refugee.

Livia placed her palm on the mirror. She shuddered upon instant. It was 
as if a million snowflakes had landed all at once on her body.
Shock waves of cold traversed her very being. Never had touching anything 
resulted in this sensation. Her body acknowledged the glass' texture not 
once but twice. Two separate touches were being fed to her mind, the first one being 
the contact with glass and remarking how smooth it was. The second touch 
allowed her to detect every speckle of dust present on the surface. Every 
imperfection from dirt to stains.

Everything was colder to her touch. Placing her hand 
on her arm, she never noticed how soft her skin was. Her hand ran through her 
arm, hair raising itself before its passage. Devoid 
of any freckles or sore spots, her skin's perfection almost irritated her.
It was never fair how she could never achieve this.

Livia smelled a strand of hair, her fingers noticing how greasy it had 
become. She must have buried her nose 
within her black hair. Vanilla imbibed with sweat and musk. Blood.
Somehow she smelled another's blood. Another? It was her blood.
Deep within its confines, laid this note which she had grown up with. Her original
body odor, overwhelmed by this new scent. Yet it still lingered below 
waiting for its chance to resurface. Would Spartak recognize it? The thought 
of it forgetting her. No she could afford this kind of sentimentality right now.
There were so many things to be done.

The princess in the mirror let out a silent scream. Tears ran from her mascara.
She struck at the mirror once, twice. It was futile and Livia wanted it 
that way. Livia smiled at her. She closed her eyes. Opening them again, 
her pupils turned blue.

"You do not understand. I need this, said Livia.

Livia jumped at the sound of that voice, one that was a few octaves higher than 
her own. She would have to adapt. It reminded her that she was commanding 
someone else's arms and legs. 
Like the puppets she had commanded, her hands would need to get 
accustomed to the strings. And the mask. Livia's mask, one 
that now covered her face in permanence. She had entered 
the world of masked carnivals where participants vaunted
their opulent crow, cat and dog masks gilded with rubies, sapphires, emeralds,
silver and gold. Livia had always wanted to unmask every one of 
these. How did one feel when their masks had fallen? Vulnerable? Afraid?
Politics had always been a game of putting on and removing masks.

The other princess' lips uttered a quiet profanity.

"I am you for the time being," said Livia

_For how long you ask?_ thought Livia.

"For ask long as it pleases me," said Livia

Livia blinked. Her blood rushed to her head. Arms and legs 
felt limp. Her heart stopped beating. 
The noise that reverberated through the back of the skull vanished.
The other princess was gone, replaced by Livia's actual reflection.
She ordered her heart to start beating anew.

Memories flooded her. Memories of having an actual mother who had planted 
kisses on her cheeks, a mother who had cradled her in her arms. Livia 
had held hands with that entity. They had ventured in Thanatopolis' streets
accompanied by Excurbitores. Commoners stood still on the sides, one still 
exhibiting swellings on the thighs or on the neck. Women held emaciated 
babes in their hands. 


"Why do we have see all these filthy people?" Livia said.


"Because I have lived my life in brothels, daughter. I know the scorn the 
purple born give after they have paid. You must never forget about our 
family's humble beginnings," said Empress Thessaly.

Livia had 
used the word mother with that being, a word she could never use with Baba. 

And then there was the father, a man who has been imprisoned in the throne 
room for most of her life. He would lock himself in his study, buried under 
edicts, proclamations and decrees. Her mother had told her that once one 
ascended to the throne, one was married to the Empire.
She would inquire questions about him only to be funneled 
to her teachers or his advisers. He thought lavish gifts such as horses, dresses, 
litters and jewels would satiate her curiosity. He was wrong. Five times. In the 
past fifteen years, she had only hugged him five times. She had called him 
Father once in court. Never has she forgotten the look of disappointment 
he gave her. He demanded she refer to him as Your August Majesty.

"Why does Father turn his face from me? He only smiles at my brother,"Livia asked 
her mother.

"You were born a princess not a prince,"said her mother.

"How difference should that make?" 

"Women have been forbidden to sit on the throne of 
phoenix feathers since Empress Zenobia. 
The realm will not suffer another empress."

"Madness!"

"It is the price we paid for having that madwoman sack Metarexia."

"Yet when emperors and kings put cities to the torch, they are called conquerors?"

"Power makes its own laws, child. 
Fairness is a luxury emperors cannot afford."

The door creaking open brought her back to the present. It was Spartak. 

Spartak wasted no time lunging at her and showering her with affection.
It sniffed her, initially upset by Livia's scent. She grabbed its 
body, bringing it closer to her. It licked her again. Livia showed it 
its favorite ball. _Want to play outside?_ Its eyes had lit up 
with childish amazement. Spartak sprinted to the vestibule's door 
at lightning speed. It emitted high-pitched barks, hitting the door
with its paws.

"Hold on! I need to try something!" said Livia.
The wardrobe was finally hers. Livia's new hands opened the revolving doors 
of the closet in her room.
Purple, white, black, fuchsia. Corsets, fur coats, lavish ball gowns, traditional
stolas and tunics made of the softest silk. Hers. All hers.
There were no shortage of colors that fitted 
her body. She settled for that crimson and onyx dress she had used with Majorian when they were still Majorian.

_Am I worthy of it like this?_ thought Livia.

Impatience flowed from the crown next to her. 
It had called her, this magnet pulling her into its sphere of influence.
Were all humans like this, drawn by this desire to see themselves 
with this ornament? 
Livia yanked it from its stand, placing it over her head.
A Medean empress stood in front the mirror. 
Her mother who abandoned her. Would she approve? Or would she wallow in
jealousy in her early grave? 
Livia wondered. So many questions that could only be answered once she 
returned to the Gates of the Underworld. The Grimoire of Red said that one who stood 
before them would reunite with the person that cared the most about them.
When she was a child, she had always hoped that her mother would await her then.
Now, the most likely candidate was Baba.

Her favorite painting, this panorama with Empress Zenobia raising her battleaxe 
over High Cardinal Pius' head greeted her overhead. Livia breathed, 
imagining herself 
wielding the same weapon, only her arms were not as muscular as Zenobia's.
Magic used another set of muscles after all. She had swung her 
imaginary axe. Again and again.
Cardinal Pius who had enslaved Zenobia and her mother. Pius who 
started Zenobia's lifelong quest for justice. Pius whose infamous pleading for 
his life had been transcribed over and over by Zenobia's sages. Pius who 
was responsible for the sacking of the Holy City under the imperial army.
One day, Livia would be courageous and paint the Man in White's face over Pius' in 
that painting.

Wings flapped. The Artifice appeared on the window.

"The first part of your gamble succeeded. What is next, my dear?" 
said Claradore.

"We have armies, why not brandish them against Sextus,"
said Livia.

The Artifice fed flies to the cobwebs in the upper corners of the room.
It has always irritated her how her old self adored doves. White was horrid 
color for a room. Livia would order the walls covered with crimson phoenixes 
and golden dragons.

"A Giant is enough to shatter any shield wall," said Claradore.

"What about Medean Fire? This vessel's memories speak of 
the Empire's hidden caches," said Livia. 

"Ah," he said, nodding slowly. "Much more... elegant. 
Should anything unfortunate occur, who could say where the blame truly lies?"

"I will begin investigating this path."

"One more thing. What should I refer to you as when you are wearing that? Nix? Livia? 
Nivia?" said the Artifice. 

"Livia will serve," said Livia. 

"Well then, my dear Livia, I look forward to seeing your play 
unfolds. The realm has seen enough emperors fall." 

Spartak barked again, reminding Livia of her promise. The Artifice departed.
They proceeded to the gardens from the elevated terrace on the palace's body.

Within the labyrinth of well-trimmed hedges, she and Spartak played ball. She threw it far far away
towards the sea. It ran after it. She would have it run after her as she escaped with the ball. 
Spartak would lunge at her, tickling her face with its tongue. Her hands rummaged through its soft fur,
showering it with kisses.
_Moments like this never last,_ thought Livia.

"Here, your favorite steak," said Livia as she flung a piece of meat 
from her satchel. She had marinated it with garlic powder, peppers and 
dried basil. Spartak lept in the air, 
gnawing at the steak before swallowing it whole.

They ran and ran turning left and right. As sunlight faded, so did the 
number of nobles leisuring in the gardens. The best part of the night had yet 
to come. Two hours past midnight, the entirety of this lush belvedere would be
vacant. She would be free 
to hear water flowing from Charov's Aqueduct and listen 
to the braziers lighting up the Hippodrome's racetrack. 
Nix and Spartak rested on the humid grass. Eight years ago, 
she could still cradle her puppy in her arms. Today, it was Spartak that 
could carry her over its body.
