Nix woke up, flailing in what appeared to a bed. Instead of seeing Serena’s face, she was disappointed to be greeted by Claradore’s Artifice. Never had she thought its lurid appearance would relieve her. Her arms billowed with burn marks. Phoenix feathers had been placed on the blisters. An throbbing pain dug into her skin.

"So, it seems you will live, my dear," cawed the Artifice.

That was not reassuring. the thing called Serena had hovered in the air, winds had howled around her white wings. The pillar of light had come, its deafening metallic sound still ringing in her ears. At that moment, all of her instincts culminated in one simple decision. Flee.

"Where are we?" Nix rasped. The room had all the attributes of a wine cellar, empty amphoras littering the corners. Paintings of spiders, some unfinished, were stacked in an unorderly pile. A small altar dedicated to the True Goddess stood in front of her bed, the deity having being painted in an amateurish manner.

"The very beginning, my dear. Where I had started my life in this new world," said the Artifice.

"Will he find us?"

"In the long term, yes. In the short term, no."

"He was a Giant."

The Artifice bit a pear with its human teeth. "I am aware of that."

"And you never bothered to inform me?"

"You know the stories. It is hard to believe that one of them still lived, my dear."

"And Serena, the Goddess? You also knew."

"Her intentions had always been a riddle."

There were too many new variables in this mathematical equation. Serena was the one addition that ruined her understanding of the situation. Was it all a lie? Were all those eight years just a test? Nix failed to see what Serena gained from such a deception. The Goddess could have eradicated both her and Claradore by flicking her fingers. Yet she has toyed with them for years pretending to be a child then a young woman. Nothing, nothing made sense in this reality. 

"Can you confirm this is not a dream," asked Nix.

The Artifice pecked her in the forehead. A jolt of pain reminded her that this was truly her new reality.

_So I lost,_ thought Nix.

Throughout history, defeat only lead to two outcomes: annihilation or a reversal of fortunes so spectacular that all historians, poets and philosophers would perform vivisections on the event for the following decades. Nix was unsure which one of these two diverging branches she would find herself in but the likelihood of the first one was higher.

"What is there to be done?" asked Nix. She removed one of the phoenix feathers applied on arms. The skin beneath it had been restored.

Spartak entered the room, carrying a basket filled with dead doves, probably her dinner for the day. Its priorities were well-defined as it jumped on the bed, showering her with affection.

"It had cried quite a lot," said Claradore.

She felt tears on her wounded face. They mixed with whatever the blisters secreted, its repulsing texture landing on her lips. "I’m sorry Spartak, I will make it up to you. I promise," said Nix.

The thing called Majorian stood at the door, sadness deforming its monstrous face.
Its wings were curled around its figure.

"You...Live..." they said.

"I would rather not be alive," said Nix.

"That...Makes...Two...Of...Us."

Baba, Serena, Majorian. Three failures that defined Nix's existence. What use was being a Magi if you failed to shield those you love from the Faith's brutality.

Majorian sang, their vocal chords using a female voice to produce a song exuding unfathomable sorrow. Nix mourned the loss of her only friend, the corruption of her lover, the maiming of hers and Claradore's body. They had chosen to challenge the will of those who presided over the Known World for a thousand years. Humans never questioned the status quo as long as it yielded stability. In fact, one could argue that freedom of will was eclipsed by stability. 

She and Spartak stayed locked in embrace as they had done the first night following Baba’s death. In the makeshift tent Claradore had made for them, Nix had emptied her body of tears and screams. Today, Spartak’s twenty-seven greater palms frame could have easily crushed her smaller body.

Unforgivable. Alexander had made her puppy cry. If only Nix could have shone a light on Serena’s masks sooner. A girl that she could have trusted with her deepest secrets and desires. A girl that would have undertaken grand adventures with her. A girl that she could display her magic before her amazed eyes, not caring about the Faith and their white robes. It had all been too good to be true. Nix had shown herself to be weak and the weak get beaten.

A droplet of blood fell on the floor. A rat surged out of its hole to drink it. Nix raised her finger, causing the stray blood to force its way into the rat’s body. She spun her index, pulling invisible strings on the animal. It gyrated, contorting its spine and tail in impossible ways. By regulating her breaths, Nix could make it fly, and so she did, each of her heartbeats dragging the rat from one corner of the room to next. Spartak chased after her toy avidly. The Artifice snickered. Nix ended the game by crashing the rat’s skull into concrete.

This was nothing compared to what she could do with her usual hosts. How many cats had she exhausted to spy on courtiers, nobles and the Emperor’s entourage? No reasonable human would ever suspect their feline friends of wearing masks. The bond between an animal and a human was immune to the disease of betrayal. Nix was both intrigued and jealous of that fact.

#emph[A cat’s face was a near perfect mask.]

"My dear, your orders are to stay hidden, all of you."

_All of us?_ thought Nix.

She turned towards Majorian. 

"Do you truly stand with us?" Nix asked them.

Majorian crept closer to her bed. It touched her bruised cheek with its claw. Somehow it still possessed a woman's docility and a man's strength. 

"They...made...me...into...a...chronicler," Majorian said. 

Claradore nodded. "This Magrub Doga spoke to me. It is a most fascinating specimen. To think Magrub Dogas could retain their will. It is not here to deceive us but to record our demise. The Faith will want the Known World to know it destroyed the Last Magi, for good. It needs a story to rally the people around its lies."

"We cannot stay here," said Nix.

"The plan is to abandon the capital and to scatter in the countryside."

Nix felt colors drain from her scarred face. Leave Thanatopolis? A wicked turn of the wheel of fate. She would accomplish Serena and Majorian's goal unwillingly. 
There were no more tears to cry. All of what the Red Guild had built in the imperial capital was for naught, undone by a single Giant. Right now as she lingered in his makeshift deathbed, Livia and Domitian returned to the city.
Without Claradore steering the ship, the rats could board the deck and seize it.
Nix had no doubt that Livia would purge Claradore's followers from court. A tactical retreat in the face of overwhelming odds was the right move. Or was it?

"Where is the princess?" asked Nix.

"My dear, you cared for the princess's fate," replied Claradore.

"Our enemies believe us broken. They grow careless. Even now they sack our camp, searching for gold that does not exist. A man hoarding riches in his arms is wide open. This is when we strike."

A wide sneer was curled on the Artifice's visage. "And how do you propose we strike? We are debilitated."

"You commanded the Red Guild to hide themselves. And what better hiding place than in plain sight? We remain within the Palace walls." 

The Artifice rotated its human head 720 degrees. Bones cracked. "My dear, this is a suicidal charge."

Nix whisked her index finger. "On the contrary, the two of cannot prevail over that Giant. Yet as you told me many times, a single Magi cannot triumph over army. And what better army than the Medean host. It only obeys one individual, does it not? If I were to become one with Livia, unite my flesh with her, that army will only answer to me."

"My dear, this is not the same as the trial from earlier. The True Goddess knows how long you must remain concealed in her body. Days? Weeks? Month? Even I cannot foresee what that might do to you both."

"It matters not. The crown is all we need."

"An...Elysian...On...The...Throne...The...Prophecy..." sang Majorian.

"Damn your prophecies! Even if it costs me my last breath, I will see this world burn and forge a new order from the ashes. And Livia is the key to our deliverance," said Nix.
