Nix woke up, flailing in what appeared to a bed. Instead of seeing Serena’s face, she was disappointed to be greeted by Claradore’s Artifice. Never had she thought its lurid appearance would relieve her. Her arms billowed with burn marks. Phoenix feathers had been placed on the blisters. An throbbing pain dug into her skin.

"So, it seems you will live, my dear," cawed the Artifice.

That was not reassuring. the thing called Serena had hovered in the air, winds had howled around her white wings. The pillar of light had come, its deafening metallic sound still ringing in her ears. At that moment, all of her instincts culminated in one simple decision. Flee.

"Where are we?" Nix rasped. The room had all the attributes of a wine cellar, empty amphoras littering the corners. Paintings of spiders, some unfinished, were stacked in an unorderly pile. A small altar dedicated to the True Goddess stood in front of her bed, the deity having being painted in an amateurish manner.

"The very beginning, my dear. Where I had started my life in this new world," said the Artifice.

"Will he find us?"

"In the long term, yes. In the short term, no."

"He was a Giant."

The Artifice bit a pear with its human teeth. "I am aware of that."

"And you never bothered to inform me?"

"You know the stories. It is hard to believe that one of them still lived, my dear."

"And Serena, the Goddess? You also knew."

"Her intentions had always been a riddle."

There were too many new variables in this mathematical equation. Serena was the one addition that ruined her understanding of the situation. Was it all a lie? Were all those eight years just a test? Nix failed to see what Serena gained from such a deception. The Goddess could have eradicated both her and Claradore by flicking her fingers. Yet she has toyed with them for years pretending to be a child then a young woman. Nothing, nothing made sense in this reality. 

"Can you confirm this is not a dream," asked Nix.

The Artifice pecked her in the forehead. A jolt of pain reminded her that this was truly her new reality.

_So I lost,_ thought Nix.

Throughout history, defeat only lead to two outcomes: annihilation or a reversal of fortunes so spectacular that all historians, poets and philosophers would perform vivisections on the event for the following decades. Nix was unsure which one of these two diverging branches she would find herself in but the likelihood of the first one was higher.

"What is there to be done?" asked Nix. She removed one of the phoenix feathers applied on arms. The skin beneath it had been restored.

Spartak entered the room, carrying a basket filled with dead doves, probably her dinner for the day. Its priorities were well-defined as it jumped on the bed, showering her with affection.

"It had cried quite a lot," said Claradore.

She felt tears on her wounded face. They mixed with whatever the blisters secreted, its repulsing texture landing on her lips. "I’m sorry Spartak, I will make it up to you. I promise," said Nix.

They stayed locked in embrace as they had done the first night following Baba’s death. In the makeshift tent Claradore had made for them, Nix had emptied her body of tears and screams. Today, Spartak’s twenty-seven greater palms frame could have easily crushed her smaller body.

Unforgivable. Alexander had made her puppy cry. If only Nix could have shone a light on Serena’s masks sooner. A girl that she could have trusted with her deepest secrets and desires. A girl that would have undertaken grand adventures with her. A girl that she could display her magic before her amazed eyes, not caring about the Faith and their white robes. It had all been too good to be true. Nix had shown herself to be weak and the weak get beaten.

A droplet of blood fell on the floor. A rat surged out of its hole to drink it. Nix raised her finger, causing the stray blood to force its way into the rat’s body. She spun her index, pulling invisible strings on the animal. It gyrated, contorting its spine and tail in impossible ways. By regulating her breaths, Nix could make it fly, and so she did, each of her heartbeats dragging the rat from one corner of the room to next. Spartak chased after her toy avidly. The Artifice snickered. Nix ended the game by crashing the rat’s skull into concrete.

This was nothing compared to what she could do with her usual hosts. How many cats had she exhausted to spy on courtiers, nobles and the Emperor’s entourage? No reasonable human would ever suspect their feline friends of wearing masks. The bond between an animal and a human was immune to the disease of betrayal. Nix was both intrigued and jealous of that fact.
