Livia found him studying a map of Thanatopolis when she woke up.
The map dated from the time of Charov when the city's construction was almost complete. Livia sauntered from the bed, her feet touched the carpets made from deer hides. Ordogan had crafted those himself. She placed her cold hands on his broad shoulders. 

"Tactics must be difficult to plan while taking into consideration magic," said Livia.

Around her, Molochian composite bows hung on the walls. Ordogan's father had been a Molochian chieftain who lost favor in the Horde's succession wars. 

"It is like playing chess with a dog as your opponent," said Ordogan.

Livia picked the queen from the chess board. It was one of the few games where a woman was the most important piece. "They say chess is a game for generals but I do not see it Magister Militum. 
Both sides start with the same pieces. The same invariant rules apply to both sides. How can one learn strategy from this when it does not even reflect real life?"

"No plan ever survives contact with the enemy's shield wall, but one can only drill their troops to ensure they deviate minimally from the agreed plan."

"And what if our legions would fail us against the Margrub Dogas?"

"The Medean Fire..."

He loathed that weapon. A weapon that was untested in combat was worth a mummer's farce according to him. Against any conventional threat, his assessment would be correct. The Medean Empire should not rely on a so-called alchemist's trick to defeat their enemies. Generals preferred sound proven methods that could be detailed and explained to the common rank and file. What was the infantryman to make of Medean Fire? Yet, Livia never admitted it, but desperation led her to explore the possibility of using Medean Fire. 

"No, my army must prevail," asserted Ordogan. He turned towards her with such sadness in his eyes that she could have wept. "You must hide on the day I will meet Sextus on the battlefield. In fact, the entire populace must be evacuated."

"You cannot ask that unreasonable request out of me. I am the Empress. What would the men say if I cowered beneath the Palace Complex?"

"War is no ball. The scale of its brutality never fails to stupefy any onlooker."

"Brutality is no concern of mine."

"The Magrub Dogas and Men of the Crucible will sack the city. There are no pleasant songs about sacking."

"And what do you propose we tell the men once all children and women have vacated the city? That they no longer have anything to protect. I have read the history books. The Barbarian King Chrodomer's host fought to the last men when they were backed against the baggage train. Their wives stabbed any man who dared to retreat."

"Do you understand what war is my love? These are monsters we face not men. I have seen men smash the heads of babes on concrete. I have seen our own soldiers hunt women in packs in Elysian cities. The Magrub Dogas' barbarity may yet to put the Donians and the Molochians to shame!"

She smirked "Do you truly believe children and women see the difference between monster and man?"

His face darkened. Of course, there would be no surrendering nor would there be any retreat. Livia tired of fleeing. Never had she come as close as decapitating the Faith. All the resources she gathered were meant to destroy a single entity: the Giant. She has committed 500 000 citizens and 40 000 soldiers to her cause. 
Should Livia fail, all of their lives would be spent. By tying their fates to her success, she ensured their loyalty and devotion to her plight.

Her lips met Ordogan's. "How about we show more optimism? Should we be found victorious, would you accept it? The crown?"

"Your brother is the Emperor."

_As loyal as ever. The perfect lapdog,_ thought Livia.

"Casualties are but certain on the battlefield. My brother is a brave soul. He will lead the vanguard against the Faith's host if given the chance. I fear for his safety," said Livia.

"Rest assured your August Majesty, no harm will come to him. My Bucellarii will escort him on the battlefield."

"Save me the optimism, general. In the advent we prevail over the Faith without an Emperor, what would become of this country?"

"There must be always be an Emperor on the throne of phoenix feathers."

"Then, will you accept it?"

Ordogan fidgeted with his hands. "The Medean Empire will never put a Molochian such as I on the throne. You of all people know that."

"If we triumph over the Faith, it is no an Emperor that will sit on the throne. It is a god."

"You speak strangely, my love."

"Think about it, Ordogan. Sextus is a spawn of the Goddess herself. What would the world think if we were to slay such a mighty beast? We would be able to challenge the Goddess herself."

"Challenge the Goddess?"

"The populace interprets the Apocalypse as a world ending cataclysm. I do not share their sentiment. Apocalypse simply means the end of one world. It is also a synonym for the beginning of another. You and I have seen how our world is puppeteered by relics of the Age of Magic. With Sextus and the Magrub Dogas 
gone, the world can finally emancipate itself from the shackles of magic and you and I will be seen as the new deities."

The more nights they spent together, the more the thought of seeing Ordogan ascend to the throne became palatable to her. The court was troubled by the believed apocalypse. There would be unsavory rumors under normal circumstances. Yet, none questioned her decision to befriend Ordogan. The end of times was coming. What was to stop the Empress from savoring her last days on this earth?

Ordogan would be an ideal partner for the throne. The army cherished him. He would be campaigning for the majority of the year, leaving her free at court. 
On the other hand, having a junior emperor as a co-ruler was an increasingly difficult task. Ralens the Younger had been easy to mold until he acquired the Gift. She already missed the days she could strap him to a desk and have him sort decrees, petitions, orders and tax reports for her.

Now it seems he took pleasure in honing his magical skills in the city's outskirts, away from prying eyes. Livia had visibly failed to instill in him the fear of being discovered by the Faith. Boys of his age had yet to know the extent 
of human brutality.
Even Claradore was not privy on his activities. Her brother never partook in any decisions but questioned all of them once he returned from his errands.

The day he would want to modify her appointments would be the day she would be undone. Ordogan The eunuch Narcissus as Magister Militri. Galla Sulpicia as Magister Sussuri and the eunuch Tribonian as Magister Officiorum. The pieces she had wanted were at the exact position she desired them to be.

And then there was the question of marriage. The coming apocalypse precipitated 
the planning of another imperial wedding. Livia did not blame him. Ralens had made a list of princesses and girls of noble descent and wished for Livia to filter them. But another Empress would only cause more issues at court. Her co-rulership would be threatened. Worse, there could be a civil war and the Empire had no appetite for that while the Faith's monsters surrounded the capital.

Instead, Livia saw the advantages of marrying someone such as Ordogan. Sealing the most respectable general under her thumb would solidify her position. She had the ring Domitian gave to her reforged into a new one. With her as his wife, the man would have no choice but to be a passenger in the ship she was captaining.
There were to be more difficult decisions to make other than the ones pertaining to Medean Fire. Livia required someone to support her actions unquestioningly. She could even reveal to him that she was a Magi, and he would not dare strike her.

He left her to train the men.

The city would be destroyed in two months. Every day, the populace sang the Faith's hymns outside the streets. Magrub Dogas watched from the roofs. From Ordogan's bedroom, Livia heard their songs. Majorian often accompanied the ensemble with their male and female voices. 

Her hair laid disheveled. The general's cologne lingered on the pillow she was hugging. This mistake she and Ordogan had made now became a habit. It was a good thing. The Magister Militum now had someone to protect from the creatures of the night. What man would not resist the temptation of being a knight in shining armor to rescue a fair maiden? 

The Artifice flew through the window.

"I did not authorize you to sire another Magi," Claradore said dryly.

"You think I had control over what happened. His powers came suddenly," said Livia.

Its neck snapped. It made a parody of a frown. "There must be no more incidents of this kind. It is one thing to create another. You are honing his skills as well! You will draw Sextus' wrath upon us! Restrain your apprentice at once, my dear!"

"The Gatekeeper has loosened our leash. I cannot tighten it without exposing myself as well."

"He plays the vigilante in the countryside. I have seen him fly to the rescue of 
farmers and limitanei. His powers are crude, unrefined. They lack the passion we both have for our craft."

"Any Magi is better than no Magi. We will be three Magi to confront him once your body has been reconstituted."

"The timeline for that is volatile, my dear."

Livia groaned. Claradore has had the fortitude of not having to deal with Sextus. 
He had chosen instead to quarrel with Serena and getting ambushed by Margrub Dogas. For the past months, Livia had carried the Red Guild's torch, reassuring 
the disciples that Claradore lived. She had ordered Claradore's followers to arm themselves for the day to come. 

"Must I do everything myself? How long must I shoulder your burdens?" asked Livia.

"The Leeches are doing all they can. You must in the meantime restrain your...Disciple. I have seen him training in the art of acrobatics at night. Some Magrub Dogas have even fallen prey to his talents," said Claradore.

It was true. The creatures Ralens practiced his swordsmanship on had all been buried by the Excubitores. She had counseled him to destroy at most one of the fell monsters per week. Instead, he was adamant about perfecting his combat aptitudes as a Magi.

"Have you grown jealous, Claradore? He is learning fast."

In a sense she envied Ralens. As Livia, her opportunities to dabble with magic were far more limited. At most, she could light the candles in her room. Her daily life now consisted of her getting buried under layers of bureaucracy and decrees. Some days, she too wished she could soar in the sky with her wings or climb the fortifications. The feeling of being freed from gravity was unmatched in the history of humanity. At court, she was bound by chains of protocol and intrigue

In a way, she had shed a life of danger for a life of comfort. Livia gazed at the discarded rose gown she had brought to Ordogan's room. The silk, the perfume, the jewelry, the mascara, the eyeliner, the adulation of the court, the army. All of these reminded her that the choice she had made was the correct one. 

The Artifice pecked her forehead, returning her to this uninteresting conversation.

"If the Emperor is getting acquainted with magic fast, he could be an asset in our future battle with Sextus," said Livia.

The Artifice shook his head. "My dear, you do not understand. You stand above a precipice. What if he realigns with the Faith?"

Livia slid into her rose gown. "He has repudiated his Faith."

"Has he truly? Faith is not easily discarded, my dear."

In a sense he was correct. One's upbringing determined one's faith. The Faith would have one believe that all children came into this world as devout believers of the Goddess. Religion was a constant in a mathematical equation for many. 
Unchangeable, Immutable, unperturbable as dried concrete. However, even concrete could not withstand indefinitely the test of time. Erosion, frost, salt, all could create cracks within the highest quality Sarvitarian roads and bridges.
For humans, this could materialize in the form of injustice or great suffering. 
It did not take long for anyone on this world to realize that any deity would never come to their rescue as a knight in shining armor. Praying was never going to be sufficient to find success trough hardship.

This alone should have sufficed to make anyone question their preformed concepts on faith. But men of the Faith could be stubborn before admitting they were wrong.
The Goddess worked in mysterious ways they would say. It is not an obligation for the Goddess to save all of her followers. All of that logic was invalidated by the fact that the Goddess was revealed to be a mere human, one that could bleed and be slain.

Livia wondered. Did the people of Holy Khigek still maintained their belief when the Sarvitarian Emperor Claudius burned their the Great Temple and scattered their folk throughout the North Sea? For twelve months, the Sarvitarians besieged the holy city of Pardis. When they finally breached its walls, they found the following inscribed by blood: if there is a Goddess, she would have to beg for my forgiveness. Serena of course never apologized to anyone for her failures.

The Artifice's chirps ended her philosophical ramblings.

"Furthermore, the more you hone his skills, the more likely he will come to discover the truth about this costume you wear," said Claradore.

"I wear his sister's skin. No, I am his sister. Even if she discovers the truth. He would not dare strike me."

"Boys of his age can be unpredictable."

"I am the master. He is the disciple."

"The student must never outshine the master. Very good, my dear."

"The Faith only expects two Magi. A third one will surely shock them. Let them believe we are far more numerous than they think. Let them flounder their resources and advantages in doubt. It will buy us time. My legions are gathering as you can see. Sextus will find Thanatopolis quite difficult to raze."
