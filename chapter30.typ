Livia found him studying a map of Thanatopolis when she woke up.
The map dated from the time of Charov when the city's construction was almost complete. Livia sauntered from the bed, her feet touched the carpets made from deer hides. Ordogan had crafted those himself. She placed her cold hands on his broad shoulders. 

"Tactics must be difficult to plan while taking into consideration magic," said Livia.

Around her, Molochian composite bows hung on the walls. Ordogan's father had been a Molochian chieftain who lost favor in the Horde's succession wars. 

"It is like playing chess with a dog as your opponent," said Ordogan.

Livia picked the queen from the chess board. It was one of the few games where a woman was the most important piece. "They say chess is a game for generals but I do not see it Magister Militum. 
Both sides start with the same pieces. The same invariant rules apply to both sides. How can one learn strategy from this when it does not even reflect real life?"

"No plan ever survives contact with the enemy's shield wall, but one can only drill their troops to ensure they deviate minimally from the agreed plan."

"And what if our legions would fail us against the Margrub Dogas?"

"The Medean Fire..."

He loathed that weapon. A weapon that was untested in combat was worth a mummer's farce according to him. Against any conventional threat, his assessment would be correct. The Medean Empire should not rely on a so-called alchemist's trick to defeat their enemies. Generals preferred sound proven methods that could be detailed and explained to the common rank and file. What was the infantryman to make of Medean Fire? Yet, Livia never admitted it, but desperation led her to explore the possibility of using Medean Fire. 

"No, my army must prevail," asserted Ordogan. He turned towards her with such sadness in his eyes that she could have wept. "You must hide on the day I will meet Sextus on the battlefield. In fact, the entire populace must be evacuated."

"You cannot ask that unreasonable request out of me. I am the Empress. What would the men say if I cowered beneath the Palace Complex?"

"War is no ball. The scale of its brutality never fails to stupefy any onlooker."

"Brutality is no concern of mine."

"The Magrub Dogas and Men of the Crucible will sack the city. There are no pleasant songs about sacking."

"And what do you propose we tell the men once all children and women have vacated the city? That they no longer have anything to protect. I have read the history books. The Barbarian King Chrodomer's host fought to the last men when they were backed against the baggage train. Their wives stabbed any man who dared to retreat."

His face darkened. Of course, there would be no surrendering nor would there be any retreat. Livia tired of fleeing. Never had she come as close as decapitating the Faith. All the resources she gathered were meant to destroy a single entity: the Giant. She has committed 500 000 citizens and 40 000 soldiers to her cause. 
Should Livia fail, all of their lives would be spent. By tying their fates to her success, she ensured their loyalty and devotion to her plight.

Her lips met Ordogan's. "How about we show more optimism? Should we be found victorious, would you accept it? The crown?"

"Your brother is the Emperor."

_As loyal as ever. The perfect lapdog,_ thought Livia.

"Casualties are but certain on the battlefield. My brother is a brave soul. He will lead the vanguard against the Faith's host if given the chance. I fear for his safety," said Livia.

"Rest assured your August Majesty, no harm will come to him. My Bucellarii will escort him on the battlefield."

The city would be destroyed in two months. Every day, the populace sang the Faith's hymns outside the streets. Magrub Dogas watched from the roofs. From Ordogan's bedroom, Livia heard their songs. Majorian often accompanied the ensemble with their male and female voices. 

Her hair laid disheveled. The general's cologne lingered on the pillow she was hugging. This mistake she and Ordogan had made now became a habit. It was a good thing. The Magister Militum now had someone to protect from the creatures of the night. What man would not resist the temptation of being a knight in shining armor to rescue a fair maiden? 

The Artifice flew through the window.

"I did not authorize you to sire another Magi," Claradore said dryly.

"You think I had control over what happened," said Livia.

Its neck snapped. It made a parody of a frown. "It is one thing to create another. You are honing his skills as well! You will draw Sextus' wrath upon us."

"Then we will be three Magi to confront him once your body has been reconstituted."

"The timeline for that is volatile, my dear."

Livia groaned. Claradore has had the fortitude of not having to deal with Sextus. 
He had chosen instead to quarrel with Serena and getting ambushed by Margrub Dogas. For the past months, Livia had carried the Red Guild's torch, reassuring 
the disciples that Claradore lived. She had ordered Claradore's followers to arm themselves for the day to come. 

"Must I do everything myself? How long must I shoulder your burdens?" asked Livia.

"The Leeches are doing all they can. You must in the meantime restrain your...Disciple. I have seen him training in the art of acrobatics at night. Some Magrub Dogas have even fallen prey to his talents," said Claradore.

It was true. The creatures Ralens practiced his swordsmanship on had all been buried by the Excubitores. She had counseled him to destroy at most one of the fell monsters per week. Instead, he was adamant about perfecting his combat aptitudes as a Magi.

"Have you grown jealous, Claradore? He is learning fast."

In a sense she envied Ralens. As Livia, her opportunities to dabble with magic were far more limited. At most, she could light the candles in her room. Her daily life now consisted of her getting buried under layers of bureaucracy and decrees. Some days, she too wished she could soar in the sky with her wings or climb the fortifications. The feeling of being freed from gravity was unmatched in the history of humanity. At court, she was bound by chains of protocol and intrigue

In a way, she had shed a life of danger for a life of comfort. Livia gazed at the discarded rose gown she had brought to Ordogan's room. The silk, the perfume, the jewelry, the mascara, the eyeliner, the adulation of the court, the army. All of these reminded her that the choice she had made was the correct one. 

The Artifice pecked her forehead, returning her to this uninteresting conversation.

"If the Emperor is getting acquainted with magic fast, he could be an asset in our future battle with Sextus," said Livia.

The Artifice shook his head. "My dear, you do not understand. You stand above a precipice. What if he realigns with the Faith?"

Livia slid into her rose gown. "He has repudiated his Faith."

"Furthermore, the more you hone his skills, the more likely he will come to discover the truth about this costume you wear."

"The Faith only expects two Magi. A third one will surely shock them. Let them believe we are far more numerous than they think. It will buy us time. My legions are gathering as you can see. Sextus will find Thanatopolis quite difficult to raze."
