The city would be destroyed in two months. Every day, the populace sang the Faith's hymns outside the streets. Magrub Dogas watched from the roofs. From Ordogan's bedroom, Livia heard their songs. Majorian often accompanied the ensemble with their male and female voices. 

Her hair laid disheveled. The general's cologne lingered on the pillow she was hugging. This mistake she and Ordogan had made now became a habit. It was a good thing. The Magister Militum now had someone to protect from the creatures of the night. What man would not resist the temptation of being a knight in shining armor to rescue a fair maiden? 

The Artifice flew through the window.

"I did not authorize you to sire another Magi," Claradore said dryly.

"You think I had control over what happened," said Livia.

Its neck snapped. It made a parody of a frown. "It is one thing to create another. You are honing his skills as well! You will draw Sextus' wrath upon us."

"Then we will be three Magi to confront him once your body has been reconstituted."

"The timeline for that is volatile, my dear."

Livia groaned. Claradore has had the fortitude of not having to deal with Sextus. 
He had chosen instead to quarrel with Serena and getting ambushed by Margrub Dogas. For the past months, Livia had carried the Red Guild's torch, reassuring 
the disciples that Claradore lived. She had ordered Claradore's followers to arm themselves for the day to come. 

"Must I do everything myself? How long must I shoulder your burdens?" asked Livia.

"The Leeches are doing all they can. You must in the meantime restrain your...Disciple. I have seen him training in the art of acrobatics at night. Some Magrub Dogas have even fallen prey to his talents," said Claradore.

It was true. The creatures Ralens practiced his swordsmanship on had all been buried by the Excubitores. She had counseled him to destroy at most one of the fell monsters per week. Instead, he was adamant about perfecting his combat aptitudes as a Magi.

"Have you grown jealous, Claradore? He is learning fast."

In a sense she envied Ralens. As Livia, her opportunities to dabble with magic were far more limited. At most, she could light the candles in her room. Her daily life now consisted of her getting buried under layers of bureaucracy and decrees. Some days, she too wished she could soar in the sky with her wings or climb the fortifications. The feeling of being freed from gravity was unmatched in the history of humanity. At court, she was bound by chains of protocol and intrigue

In a way, she had shed a life of danger for a life of comfort. Livia gazed at the discarded rose gown she had brought to Ordogan's room. The silk, the perfume, the jewelry, the mascara, the eyeliner, the adulation of the court, the army. All of these reminded her that the choice she had made was the correct one. 

The Artifice pecked her forehead, returning her to this uninteresting conversation.

"If the Emperor is getting acquainted with magic fast, he could be an asset in our future battle with Sextus," said Livia.

The Artifice shook his head. "My dear, you do not understand. You stand above a precipice. What if he realigns with the Faith?"

Livia slid into her rose gown. "He has repudiated his Faith."

"Furthermore, the more you hone his skills, the more likely he will come to discover the truth about this costume you wear."

"The Faith only expects two Magi. A third one will surely shock them. Let them believe we are far more numerous than they think. It will buy us time. My legions are gathering as you can see. Sextus will find Thanatopolis quite difficult to raze."
