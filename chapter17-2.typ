Serena sat atop the sea. Waves caressed her feet. Fog obstructed her vision. 
She sang a lullaby in the Forgotten tongue, her voice hitting high-pitched and low-pitched notes with clinical perfection. Her sorrow for her lost son guided 
her melody though decrescendos and crescendos. Tears flowed from her old eyes 
as she remembered his first steps, his first words, his first hunt, his first love to the day she struck a spear through his breastplate. For a millennium, 
she had ceased to exist, wandering around the Known World to sing her song of remorse. It was only when the Gatekeeper refused her pleas to undo her actions that she realized that the powerful could become powerless.

Serena took one step feeling her toes touch the quiet waters. She rotated around a single foot, pouring her tears into her voice. 
There was once a time 
when Magi could use rivers and oceans as walkways, constellations serving as guiding lights. Ships were but primitive constructs by the non-Magi who were desperate to mimic their masters. Before the Magi tamed and bred dragons, wars were even fought on bodies of water. Serena had been too young to live these simpler times.

A shadow was plowing through the mist. A small silhouette. It was a man's. 
He had been courteous enough to accept her invitation. This had to be done out of reach of Nix's ears. The poor Phoenix Wing's heart would be sundered in two should she know what would be transpiring here mere miles away from the shores 
of Thanatopolis. 

More chess pieces had converged at the imperial capital. With the miscreant that was Alexander prowling the streets, Serena did not know if she could keep the facade of being a pawn on the board. The Red Guild and the Faith would soon unsheathe their steel, and she had to decide whether she would reveal herself to the queen. 

And so she sang to mourn the last eight years she had spent as Nix's friend. 
When the man would reach her position, he most certainly would for a dance. Serena did not doubt that she could lead the dance. 

"You have come, Dorian," said Serena.

"You have eluded me for so long, Goddess," said Claradore.

"I was not hiding. I have granted you eight years."

"You believe yourself to be giver of gits, now? Is death the gift you offered my people?"

"I do not deny it."

Claradore weaved his blood filaments into a sword. 
"Then, you know why I have come,"

Serena pointed to a set of eight doves soaring above them. "Your strength is wasted here, Dorian. The Giant is watching us,"

"Then I hope he will love seeing your limbs scattered across the sea."

"You will let him play your strings as if you were a harp? The arbiter is the one who prevails when two gladiators fight to the death."

"Do not insult my intelligence, you are the one who pulls the strings."

"That was then. Alexander is no friend of mine any longer."

"A pathetic lie."

"Is it?"

Serena knew he would be as stubborn as a raging bull. She discarded her hooded cloak. Her heartbeat slowed. Feets tingled as they liquefied. She closed her eyes, murmuring cants she had long learned by heart. Hidden tattoos glowed on her back. Bones cracked. Blood 
swirled. Strands of white hair fell from her forehead. Wrinkles appeared on her arms, legs.

"Come, strike me," said Serena.

"What sort of trick is this, Goddess?"

"There is no trick, Dorian. It is not my intent to fight you."

"You make a mockery of my volition!"
