Serena sat atop the sea. Waves caressed her feet. Fog obstructed her vision. 
She sang a lullaby in the Forgotten tongue, her voice hitting high-pitched and low-pitched notes with clinical perfection. Her sorrow for her lost son guided 
her melody though decrescendos and crescendos. Tears flowed from her old eyes 
as she remembered his first steps, his first words, his first hunt, his first love to the day she struck a spear through his breastplate. For a millennium, 
she had ceased to exist, wandering around the Known World to sing her song of remorse. It was only when the Gatekeeper refused her pleas to undo her actions that she realized that the powerful could become powerless.

Serena took one step feeling her toes touch the quiet waters. She rotated around a single foot, pouring her tears into her voice. 
There was once a time 
when Magi could use rivers and oceans as walkways, constellations serving as guiding lights. Ships were but primitive constructs by the non-Magi who were desperate to mimic their masters. Before the Magi tamed and bred dragons, wars were even fought on bodies of water. Serena had been too young to live these simpler times.

A shadow was plowing through the mist. A small silhouette. It was a man's. 
He had been courteous enough to accept her invitation. This had to be done out of reach of Nix's ears. The poor Phoenix Wing's heart would be sundered in two should she know what would be transpiring here mere miles away from the shores 
of Thanatopolis. 

More chess pieces had converged at the imperial capital. With the miscreant that was Alexander prowling the streets, Serena did not know if she could keep the facade of being a pawn on the board. The Red Guild and the Faith would soon unsheathe their steel, and she had to decide whether she would reveal herself to the queen. 

And so she sang to mourn the last eight years she had spent as Nix's friend. 
When the man would reach her position, he most certainly would for a dance. Serena did not doubt that she could lead the dance. 

"You have come, Dorian," said Serena.

"You have eluded me for so long, Goddess," said Claradore.

"I was not hiding. I have granted you eight years."

"You believe yourself to be giver of gits, now? Is death the gift you offered my people?"

"I do not deny it."

Claradore weaved his blood filaments into a sword. 
"Then, you know why I have come,"

Serena pointed to a set of eight doves soaring above them. "Your strength is wasted here, Dorian. The Giant is watching us,"

"Then I hope he will love seeing your limbs scattered across the sea."

"You will let him play your strings as if you were a harp? The arbiter is the one who prevails when two gladiators fight to the death."

"Do not insult my intelligence, you are the one who pulls the strings."

"That was then. Alexander is no friend of mine any longer."

"A pathetic lie."

"Is it?"

Serena knew he would be as stubborn as a raging bull. She discarded her hooded cloak. Her heartbeat slowed. Feet tingled as they liquefied. She closed her eyes, murmuring cants she had long learned by heart. Hidden tattoos glowed on her back. Bones cracked. Blood 
swirled. Strands of silver hair fell from her forehead. Wrinkles appeared on her arms, legs.

Once she reopened her eyes, the water showed the visage of an elderly woman, 
one whose eyes that seen the world wither without magic. 

"I see immortality has taken its toll on you. How did it feel to see friends, lovers and children die before you?" said Claradore.

"A mild sacrifice for peace and stability."

Claradore laughed. "Do not play me for a fool. Even you do not swallow your own lies."

"Come, strike me," said Serena.

Claradore raised his blood blade. His peafowl wings surged from his back. For this day, he had chosen turquoise and emerald for his panaches. Radiant eye-spots illuminated his surroundings, dissipating the thick fog. 

Serena unwinded her arms. She did not even conjure a weapon of her own in response.

"What sort of trick is this, Goddess?" spat Goddess.

"There is no trick, Dorian. It is not my intent to fight you."

"You make a mockery of my volition!"

"I have walked the path that you have chosen. It will leave you a hollow shell of a man."

"The slayer of millions speaks of morality. How amusing."

A shrill scream pierced their arena. Serena saw colors drain from Claradore's face. She could not judge him as she too was at a loss for words. Every component of her body turned to her distant memories. What could produce such a vile sound?
Her mind provided the answer but Serena queried it again for another and another. 
There was only an infinitesimal probability that Margrub Dogas had returned to the Known World. She had destroyed all of the Magis' Forges.

More ghastly cries tore through the sky. The outline of flyers was visible in the firmament. Five, no ten, no twenty of them approached her location. Seeing one Magrub Doga after a millennium was already an unpleasant experience. An army of them indicated a world destabilizing problem. 

As the fiends slowly descended towards them, Serena saw their inhumanly gorgeous faces, mixing animal eyes with human skin. The smell of rotten peaches and apples soon inundated the air. Nightmarish cackling resonated above them. 
Similar to the Magis' armies of the Age of Ancient, the Magrub Dogas were equipped with  blades made from human bones and with shields plastered with a shrunken miserable human face.

"They are not your allies I presume," said Claradore.

"I do not operate a Forge for my own leisure."

"Then, that only leaves one suspect, my dear. How do you think he acquired a Forge?"

This was a question she too wanted an answer. The Magrub Dogas were unlikely to 
be interrogated despite them being once human. Her new enemy did not have Claradore's patience. They swooped from the clouds, brandishing their fell weapons. Serena recited the cants of the Primordial Men. Her luminescent tattoos shone. With mere words, water weltered around her, accelerating their currents. Revolving flows formed maelstroms, espousing the shape of 
serpentine dragons. Her soul roared as ferociously as the water snakes. One by 
one the Magrub Dogas came, their blades challenging her summons. With each word, 
each breath, she sent her aquatic dragons crashing down the creatures.
The screams of the drowning abominations percolated through the air. 

Serena danced, bringing forth dark clouds. The Margrub Dogas showed glimpses of 
intelligence as they showered her with arrows, their tips made of human teeth. 
Some projectiles nicked her arms and legs. It mattered not. With waving hands, lightning erupted from the black clouds, striking the airborne enemy. Dismembered torsos, heads and limbs fell into the sea. 

She took a brief respite to glance at Claradore's situation. Bloated corpses floated next to the Red Guild's leader. A Magrub Doga's spear had found its way through his groin. 

"How many have we slain?"

"Above fifty."

"A Forge can birth fifty creatures in a year's turning."

"The enemy must have accumulated more. This must be a fraction of their strength."

"All the reason why we must destroy their Forge, and soon."

"The Goddess suggesting joining hands with the Red Guild? The Old Gods be merciful, the Apocalypse must draw near."
