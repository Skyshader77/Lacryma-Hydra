Livia knew he was hiding in the royal chapel. She found the crown sitting on the throne. The statues of Zenobia and Zastrian stared at her. She met their implacable gaze. What were they thinking from the other side of the Gates? Were they laughing in derision at the mediocrity of her decisions? Or were they content in accusing her of going down a peripatetic path that ultimately led to ruin? Only history would judge Livia. No other ruler had to contend with the return of magic.

The scent of wine and honey wafted through the emptied throne room. It helped mask her own squalor. Leila's clothes stank of musk and sweat. Senators and courtiers had dispersed to the neighboring provinces. In the banquet room next door, the nobility that still remained feasted as if there would be no tomorrow. 
As much as their turpitude irked Livia, the threat of an usurpation lingered above her head. She did not want to provide an excuse for a coup not when the destruction of the capital loomed.

Livia picked her brother's crown. The Emperor's diadem has always been more radiant than the Empress'. Rubies, diamonds and emeralds adorned a civic crown. Dried phoenix feathers hung from the base of the diadem. She placed the jewelry on her head.

"Livia," said Ordogan's voice.

She gasped. Ordogan stood behind her. They leapt into each other's arms.

"My love, you kept me worried. The Excubitores said they had lost you and...Your brother," said Ordogan.

"The Faith sent the mob after my brother and I."

"Your brother...He...is a Magi? You-You must have known."

Livia looked up to meet his wounded eyes. She teared up.

"I have always known, my love. I am no betrayer of my blood," admitted Livia.

"You must understand what I must do," said Ordogan.

She did. Sooner or later, the news of the Magi Emperor would reach Sextus' wax ridden ears. The confirmation that the Empire harbored Magi in its seat of power would seal its fate. The Faith would be galvanized in their intent to raze the capital. Blame should shift to the Purpleborn, not the Cardinals. The court and the populace would demand a sacrifice.

"Please...He is my brother. You must let him live," said Livia.

"Livia, you are still young. Our duty transcends the bonds of blood."

"He is but a boy! He did not choose this life. I-I can help him."

"Help him? He is a Magi! He will enslave all of us if left unchecked! Do you think I took pleasure in killing my own brother? You said it yourself: safety of the state precedes all morality," said Ordogan.

The safety of the state preceded all morality. Her brother or her crown it would be. Had she still been Nix, she would have flown to Ralens' side and have him join the Red Guild's ranks. A former Emperor as a disciple of Claradore would be a useful asset. Together, they would have assaulted Sextus and perished in the final ballad of magic. Livia was no longer Nix. Magic was but a fleeting memory of her youth. All she has known since being blessed with her current body was the ability to tame fate. The thrill of the world's adulation surpassed the pleasure derived from casting any spell. Magic had never allowed anyone to command hundreds of thousands nor a million souls. Authority in fact was the ultimate spell. 

Without a state, there would no empire, no crown, no lavish gowns to wear, no exquisite perfumes to smell. Ordogan's words were sound. In addition, should Ralens continue to explore the tomes and cants of Old, he could surpass Livia's own magical capabilities. That could not be allowed. She would lose all of her persuasive tools.

The hollow ringing of the mechanical birds brought her back to her conversation.

"The Empire needs a new Emperor soon," said Livia.

"We will discuss in due time. We have two Magi to destroy."

Ordogan's soldiers encircled the chapel. 

"I will negotiate their surrender," said Livia.
