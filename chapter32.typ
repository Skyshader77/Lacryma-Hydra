Livia knew he was hiding in the royal chapel. She found the crown sitting on the throne. The statues of Zenobia and Zastrian stared at her. She met their implacable gaze. What were they thinking from the other side of the Gates? Were they laughing in derision at the mediocrity of her decisions? Or were they content in accusing her of going down a peripatetic path that ultimately led to ruin? Only history would judge Livia. No other ruler had to contend with the return of magic.

The scent of wine and honey wafted through the emptied throne room. It helped mask her own squalor. Leila's clothes stank of musk and sweat. Senators and courtiers had dispersed to the neighboring provinces. In the banquet room next door, the nobility that still remained feasted as if there would be no tomorrow. 
As much as their turpitude irked Livia, the threat of an usurpation lingered above her head. She did not want to provide an excuse for a coup not when the destruction of the capital loomed.

Livia picked her brother's crown. The Emperor's diadem has always been more radiant than the Empress'. Rubies, diamonds and emeralds adorned a civic crown. Dried phoenix feathers hung from the base of the diadem. She placed the jewelry on her head.

"Livia," said Ordogan's voice.

She gasped. Ordogan stood behind her. They leapt into each other's arms.

"My love, you kept me worried. The Excubitores said they had lost you and...Your brother," said Ordogan.

"The Faith sent the mob after my brother and I."

"Your brother...He...is a Magi? You-You must have known."

Livia looked up to meet his wounded eyes. She teared up.

"I have always known, my love. I am no betrayer of my blood," admitted Livia.

"You must understand what I must do," said Ordogan.

She did. Sooner or later, the news of the Magi Emperor would reach Sextus' wax ridden ears. The confirmation that the Empire harbored Magi in its seat of power would seal its fate. The Faith would be galvanized in their intent to raze the capital. Blame should shift to the Purpleborn, not the Cardinals. The court and the populace would demand a sacrifice.

"Please...He is my brother. You must let him live," said Livia.

"Livia, you are still young. Our duty transcends the bonds of blood."

"He is but a boy! He did not choose this life. I-I can help him."

"Help him? He is a Magi! He will enslave all of us if left unchecked! Do you think I took pleasure in killing my own brother? You said it yourself: safety of the state precedes all morality," said Ordogan.

The safety of the state preceded all morality. Her brother or her crown it would be. Had she still been Nix, she would have flown to Ralens' side and have him join the Red Guild's ranks. A former Emperor as a disciple of Claradore would be a useful asset. Together, they would have assaulted Sextus and perished in the final ballad of magic. Livia was no longer Nix. Magic was but a fleeting memory of her youth. All she has known since being blessed with her current body was the ability to tame fate. The thrill of the world's adulation surpassed the pleasure derived from casting any spell. Magic had never allowed anyone to command hundreds of thousands nor a million souls. Authority in fact was the ultimate spell. 

Without a state, there would no empire, no crown, no lavish gowns to wear, no exquisite perfumes to smell. Ordogan's words were sound. In addition, should Ralens continue to explore the tomes and cants of Old, he could surpass Livia's own magical capabilities. That could not be allowed. She would lose all of her persuasive tools.

The hollow ringing of the mechanical birds brought her back to her conversation.

"The Empire needs a new Emperor soon," said Livia.

"We will discuss in due time. We have two Magi to destroy."

Ordogan's soldiers encircled the chapel, forming a shield wall around the complex. A makeshift battery ram had been built. The first speckles of snow fell. A snowflake tingled Livia's cheek. Years ago she had fought Ralens here with snow balls, trying to assail his snow castle with her projectiles. Here he was now besieged again by her forces.

They said a Magrub Doga joined the former Emperor's company. It could be no other than Majorian. Her stomach rumbled. She has not eaten since noon. Visions of honey laced pastries and sponge cakes invaded her thoughts. Livia had taken the habit of having trays of food delivered to hers or Ordogan's room. To this day, there had been no visible changes in her waist's diameter. Seeing the handmaidens' risible jealousy whenever Livia gobbled meatballs was a treat of its own. 

"The attack will commence momentarily, Livia," said Ordogan.

It was out of the question that further bloodshed would disrupt her appetite.

"There is no need. I will negotiate their surrender. We have shed much blood to day already," said Livia.

His eyes widened. "You intend to confront a Magrub Doga and a Magi alone?"

She turned towards her army and declared: "I am the Empress. If I am not to lead the charge, who would even follow me?"

She sashayed through the ranks of Excubitores and Scholae Palatinae.
Claws marks found their way on the old wooden door. A large crack allowed her eye through.

"Brother, it is me," said Livia.

"L-Liiva? T-tell the men to go away...I-I am the Emperor," said Ralens.

"Let me in, brother. You must understand the predicament you are in."

"I sense a trap, your Highness," said Majorian's voice.

Livia muffled a groan of exasperation. "If it was truly a trap, both of your heads would be found in front of the Palace Complex by now."

The door creaked. She pushed her hand through. The smell of blood and thyme 
permeated the interior. Fallen chairs, broken windows greeted her eyes. A claw mark, probably Majorian's doing, had ripped the Goddess' face on all frescoes present. Ralens laid on the altar. Blood seeped from his thigh and arms. Not fatal thankfully. A crust of yellow pus had begun to form on the wound

Livia wasted no time in applying her hands on the festering wound. She recited the Cants of Serdonia. Cerulean ellipses emanated from her palms. His blood waltzed, making pirouettes across her fingers. Black fluids escaped the wound.
Livia let the foul liquid touch the marble floor. His blood was warm in her hands. She pulled every filament of blood as if it was silk. When she could no longer see any black bile within her brother's blood, she allowed the threads to reenter his body.

"L-Livia, you are truly a prodigy," said Ralens.

He stood up rapidly, waving his legs and arms as if his body was never injured.
Paleness slowly disappeared from his body. She held his wrist. His breathing accelerated, no longer being slow and sickly. The warm smile she has always known greeted her anew.
Majorian made a sigh of relief.

"It is one less problem to worry about," said Majorian.

Livia released Ralens' wrist. "We are still in the eye of the storm. The situation has deteriorated for us," said Livia.

"I-I am the Emperor. The men will laid down their arms. O-Ordogan will cease this mummer's farce."

She shook her head. "Ordogan is doing no mummer's farce, brother. The whole world knows you are a Magi. You are well ware what this world does to Magi."

"N-No, no, they must obey me! Magi or not, I am my father's heir! The laws of the Empire apply, notwithstanding Magi."

"Do you think you can undo a millennium of beliefs, brother? The men are conditioned to slay Magi at first sight. Should you want to keep your throne, you would have to slaughter the entire populace, leaving you an Emperor of nothing."

"You must help me then! I-I am no threat to them. T-tell them!"

Livia pressed her arms against him. She did not envy his position. Relinquishing one's divine right to rule was also an unpleasant affair. Emperors and Kings clung to the throne like creeping vines to a marble column. The crown is to be worn until death and often death came brutally.

"I have already spoken to Ordogan, brother..."

"What have you negotiated?" said Ralens.

She held her breath. "You are to flee from here, never to return. There is only the Unknown World to turn to..."

"N-No-No! You jest, sister! You jest!"

"This is the official result of my talks. I however do not intend to send you away. You must hide in the underground while I plan our next move." 

"How are you planning to deal this Sextus? Surely the Cardinal will be fond of leaving a Magi alive," asked Majorian.

"With enough luck, it will be possible to find another boy who shares your face. I will say you were slain while escaping my clutches. The Faith will be none the wiser."

Ralens seized her hand. Eyes filled with despair and incomprehension met her gaze. "No! No! I will not be cast asides, sister! Y-You need me to vanquish Sextus! Help me kill those who challenge our rule! We will triumph over this together as we always have!"

A brave yet foolish speech. He had exposed himself and now threatened to sacrifice her secrecy as well. Unlike her, his discovery of magic had transformed him into the embodiment of egoism. Where was she in his equation? There was no team when all what he had done was to dismiss her counsel. 

"I cannot, as you know, I too must keep my magical secrets," said Livia.

Ralens gritted his teeth. "Liar! I know why you share Ordogan's bed every night. It is the same as with Domitian!"

Livia swallowed her own saliva. The nerve. She slapped him.

"Don't you dare put Ordogan on the same pedestal as that mongrel Domitian! Have you lost the ability to discern honor? You shame both of us at this very moment!"

Ralens cackled with his bloodied lips. She struck again.

"So it is true. Do you think me for a fool? You fornicate with him to have a heir." He brought his bruised face closer to hers."You want Ordogan as an Emperor and you want that boy to sit on my throne. I am disposable to you at this point, sweet sister. It would not even be a surprise if you were the one who summoned this mob."

"Ludicrous. Listen at your words. I have always been your staunchest ally."

Ralens put his hands around her neck. She punched him on his visage. He roared in pain. 

"Hehe, it all ends if I kill you right here, right now, does it not, sweet sister?"

Livia unveiled her blood blade. Her instincts demanded she deal the killing blow.
Majorian rushed to place themselves between her and her ungrateful brother.

"I will forgive this transgression as you are my brother..." said Livia.

Majorian's face brightened at that last word. "You have still not told him?" hissed Majorian.

"There is nothing to tell, Magrub Doga. You two are to hide in the underground for the time being. I will handle Sextus."

The cracking of wood pealed through their conversation. The head of the battery ram protruded from the severed door. Shields with the crimson phoenix emerged.
Majorian held Ralens by the arms. They burst through the chapel's upper windows.
Livia watched as they fled towards uncertainty.

She felt Ordogan's large hand over her shoulder.

"My love...Are you hurt?" said Ordogan.

"N-No. They proved to be...quite amicable. They agreed to leave for the Unknown World," said Livia.

"Can they be trusted, my love?" asked Ordogan.

_No. It is best if I assume them to be malicious actors,_ thought Livia.
