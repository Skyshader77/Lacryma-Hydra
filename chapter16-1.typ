Nix leaned against the balustrade of the imperial balcony. From her vantage point, the North Sea seemed like a plate of crystalline water beneath the sun.
She had never seen the sea as calm as it was today.

Behind her, Majorian sang the ballad of the Goddess' War against the nascent Elysian Empire. Serena complemented their voice with a lute. A total of eight 
emptied amphoraes laid next to Serena's feet. Serena had once boasted to Nix that no living man could match her in a drinking game. Seeing her friend yodelling 
on the balcony while not missing a single note confirmed the accuracy of the claim.

Back in the rotating table, a most delectable scene unfolded before her eyes. 
Boniface, Livia and Domitian were clenching their utensils as if they were swords. Their eyes were animated by mutual distrust. It was difficult to maintain the mask of a sphinx under these circumstances. 

Nix glared at the princess' golden shawl collar atop the robe in earthly tones. 
Livia had painstakingly framed her eyes in kohl dark lines. Her lips were as red as the Medean Phoenix.  Her painted skin was as white as porcelain from the Unknown World. This was the preparation that conveyed the angelic appearance the 
purple born wanted to display to anyone they graced their presence with in the throne room. Nix had been one of the handmaidens who spent three hours with the princess to craft that look. The advantage it conferred her was that she could replicate it with Majorian the next time Livia would vacate the capital.

Boniface sulked in his chair, stabbing his lamb and squeezing every last droplet of blood out of it. Dark shadows were traced under his eyes. It was an unfortunate turn of events that he had his slave drink the well's waters the day after Nix used her special concoction. Fifty Men of the Crucible lost their eyesight in a single of day. The Faith looked for culprits to point their daggers towards.

Baba's skull laid next to Boniface. It mocked Nix, reminding her that this 
repulsive man still lived. _Rest assured Baba, slowly but surely his time will come,_ thought Nix.

Men of the Crucible and Domitian's household guards faced each other in the opposite sides of the room. Since only Excubitores could wield steel in the Palace Complex, clubs and knives were the weapons of choice at this occasion.

"We were given but little notice of this gathering," said Livia who was cutting 
her marinated duck in equally sized portions.

"You have betrayed us," spat Boniface. Never had Nix taken so much pleasure of seeing this vile man riled up. She hid a smile. It was only the beginning of his torment.

"We had nothing to do with the Faith's infighting, High Cardinal."

"Infighting? The Men of the Crucible's loyalty is not to be questioned, little girl! I have handpicked every one of them!"

Domitian knocked on the round table, his fist almost toppling a sponge cake next to his fiancee. 

"Mind your tongue, Cardinal. You will show my fiancee the respect she deserves."

Livia put two grapes in her mouth. "Who else could have poisoned the well, Cardinal?"

"You people mock me with your condescension. The Underworld will take you all.
Making alliances only to flash your daggers during negotiations. Utterly despicable. Even Molochian heathens are more honorable."

"Have you not considered the most obvious possibility, old man? Claradore. He played you like a harp."

"No one plays the Faith like a harp." He turned towards Majorian who was dressed in a Scholae Palatinae's garb.
"And why do you tolerate that freak in your palace? I know that he is an aberration of nature."

"The man sings well, Cardinal. There is no better singer in the Known World. Let us return to the topic at hand. It is likely a ploy of the Magister Herboraum," said Livia.

"Hah! You want me to believe a man that abhors clothes is intelligent enough to device this stratagem."

"He is not to be underestimated."

Domitian groaned in exasperation. "We squander time here, Livia. The Eastern Army will be grouping here in weeks. Let us use it to smash that half naked man."

"That is our contingency, my love. We have already sent pigeons with the orders."

_So the army gathers at Thanatopolis._

"It seems there is no more need of conversing here. Pray you do not find yourself in our way," said Livia.

"The sword calls the axe sharp."

Domitian snickered. "This is no time for bluffs, Cardinal."

"You idiotic purpleborn. Your empire's decadence is visible to all. Look at all the rot that has taken hold in twenty years of Ralens the Elder's reign. A man exposing his upper body can now waddle in court."  He pointed to Nix. "Heathen Elysians now feed Medeans and unnatural freaks of nature desecrate your holy lands. A storm is coming, one powered by the Goddess' will itself. Purgatory awaits all of you who will be caught in it." 


"Purgatory you say?" boomed Claradore's voice.

The terrace's doors vaulted open. Claradore waltzed in with a nude male and a female virgin in his muscular arms. Livia and Domitian leered at Boniface who was muttering curses. Nix enjoyed every development of this adventure. She sipped a 
glass of fine wine. Besides her, Serena snored loudly in Majorian's arms, the latter not willing to move one inch lest he want to invoke Serena's drunken 
anger.

"Magister Herboraum, it is a... surprise to see you," said Livia dryly.

"Your lies are plain, princess. He must be your guest," said Boniface.

"Sully her name again, and I'll whip your virgin buttocks," said Domitian.

"My, my, this is quite the reception you are giving me, my friends," said Claradore.  Nix almost burst out laughing. "What is it I hear through these walls? Talks about coups, about bringing purgatory on this earth. The Emperor has only sat on the throne for a month!"

Behind Claradore, Red Acolytes armed with knives infiltrated the premises. Their numbers dwarfed the combined might of Domitian and Boniface's forces.
Domitian grabbed the hilt of his ceremonial sword. His household guards all stared at him, awaiting orders. Livia touched his hand, shaking her head. Boniface's face drained its colors.

"You have doomed all of us, priest," said Domitian.

"My dear Purpleborn and Cardinal, I believe we are being overdramatic here. It is not my intention to shed blood in the Palace Complex. Forgiveness after all is the greatest virtue the Goddess has taught us, is it not?" Claradore glanced at 
Boniface who as furiously serrating his lamb.

His audience remained silent. The Red Guild had neutralized both the scheming princess and the Faith without shedding a single drop of blood. Consolidation of power was the most principle that was taught to the purple born. Civil wars were birthed out of the womb of instability. When one ascended to the throne, it was thus imperative to dispose quietly of one's pretenders and rivals.  

"I am quite ashamed of you, Magister Militum. To think you could abuse of the Emperor's trust in you." He turned to Livia. "And you, his own sister. Isn't the blood of the covenant thicker than water? Have you no shame? For her role in this conspiracy, the princess and her fiancee will take an extended vacation to the city of Marropolis," said Claradore.

_Equivalent to exile,_thought Nix.

"And the title of Magister of Magister Militum?" asked Nix. Domitian shot her 
a blood thirsty gaze. She winked at him.

"The Comes Ordogan is to return to the capital for his new title."

"You are handing command of the army to a Molochian half breed!" shouted Domitian.

"You are correct...Comes," said Claradore. 

In that instant, Domitian unraveled his sword, pointing it at Claradore. Livia and Boniface shrieked. The Red Acolytes brandished their knives. Nix's dagger spun in her palm. Serena had woken up and whistled. Majorian hid behind Nix.

"Naked swine, I will end you today!" declared Domitian.

With bullish agility, Domitian charged towards Claradore who let go of the male and female virgins in his arms. The Crimson Spider titled to the side, letting the sword glide past his broad shoulders. Nix saw her professor grab Domitian's wrist,
yanking it upwards. Claradore's hand connected with Domitian's temple. The former 
Magister Militum slumped downwards. Livia rushed to check his pulse.

Domitian's household guards would not allow the man who humiliated their lord to go unmolested. Their eyes betrayed their intentions too clearly. Nix shouted an order. The Red Acolytes glided towards them, their blades flirting with the guards' throat. 

"He will live," said Claradore. He gestured to the Red Acolytes to surround the princess. "It seems the princess and her consort pose a threat to our safety, Cardinal. They are thus to depart immediately for Marropolis, never to return to these halls. For your own safety, you will stay in the Palace Complex from the next week onwards. You will a personal assistant. The handmaiden Nix here will now tend to his every need."

"It would be my honor to serve a pious man such as the Cardinal," said Nix.

"You think you've won Magister Militum?" said Livia. Her eyes wandered around the room. " Am I the only one who sees your deceit? Are you all simpletons? You feign ignorance Claradore but the demon who possessed me moons ago was your doing. I am certain. You will lead this country to desolation."

Claradore sighed 
"Must we go through this again, my dear princess? There are no such things as demons in the Known World. As I have said to you countless times, magic has long been extinct."

"For once, the Magister Militum speaks the truth, Princess," said Boniface.
Claradore raised an eyebrow in response. Nix never expected the Cardinal to agree with Claradore on any matter.

Red Acolytes led Livia and Domitian out of the imperial balcony. Nix would not miss any of them.

"What about Giants, Cardinals," asked Nix. "Us handmaidens are quite impressed by sir Alexander's size."

"What do you mean, Nix? Sir Alexander is as tall as me," said Majorian.

Boniface smirked. "So you noticed it..." He approached her. His wrinkled face 
with its dry lips did not seem as frightening as it did eight years ago. 
"Do I know you, girl?"

"I believe not, your Holiness. I am just a plain Elysian servant."

"Wise answer. A bit too wise...Sir Alexander is a phenomenal individual. The Faith would be nothing without him. So yes, he is a giant of sorts."

"May I ask why Cardinal Alexander could not join us tonight? Surely he would love celebrating after this turn of events?"

"The man is undergoing a pilgrimage at the Exiles' Island. I am sure there will be plenty of opportunities to get acquainted with him."

Serena's eyes brightened at that statement, her eyes crossing with Nix's. 
It would be done. Unlimited private access to Boniface. The other Cardinal was out of the canvass as well. Boniface was but a single variable to solve in her equation. The things she could do to that man. It would have to look like a suicide. Then, she would reclaim Baba's skull and return to Miroconium to bury the remains. Yes, that was a sound plan.

Nix and Majorian had made the right assumption when they deduced Livia's room would be available after the spectacle in the imperial balcony. As expected, in her haste, the princess left the attire she wore mere hours ago on the bed. Nix wasted no second in borrowing it. The unique flagrance composed of jasmine, roses lingered on the exquisite silk. 

Nix spun in front Livia's mirror admiring her new self. With the princess having left the capital possibly permanently, this room could be hers. Yet she knew the young Emperor would someday marry and would use it to seize his sister's domain for his wife. But at this very moment, everything in Livia's collection was Nix's to borrow.

She felt the gentle touch of Majorian's hands on her hips. 

"The Goddess be cursed, we were defeated by an Elysian,"said Nix as a parody of Livia's voice.

"My love, my weak muscles were not a match for Claradore's," said Majorian as Domitian. Nix snorted.

Majorian waved his arms in the same manner as Domitian had, even mimicking the manner in which the former Magister Militum stumbled next to Claradore.

Nix cleared her throat. "Hah! My dear, No man can withstand the charm of my biceps," said Nix trying to coil her arms like Claradore would do when sculptors and painters arrived to portray him.

"Mark my words, vengeance will be mine!"

"And now what will happen to that poor poor man Boniface, alone in the Palace with the hyenas?" said Nix switching back to her imitation of Livia's voice.

"Little Nix here will send him into early retirement," said Majorian with their normal voice.

"And after she is done with the Man in White?"

"She will marry this person right here."

Their lips met. A perfect end to this superb evening.
