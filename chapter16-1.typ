Nix leaned against the balustrade of the imperial balcony. From her vantage point, the North Sea seemed like a plate of crystalline water beneath the sun.
She had never seen the sea as calm as it was today.

Behind her, Majorian sang the ballad of the Goddess' War against the nascent Elysian Empire. 

Back in the rotating table, a most delectable scene unfolded before her eyes. 
Boniface, Livia and Domitian were clenching their utensils as if they were swords. Their eyes were animated by mutual distrust. It was difficult to maintain the mask of a sphinx under these circumstances. 

Nix glared at the princess' golden shawl collar atop the robe in earthly tones. 
Livia had painstakingly framed her eyes in kohl dark lines. Her lips were as red as the Medean Phoenix.  Her painted skin was as white as porcelain from the Unknown World. This was the preparation that conveyed the angelic appearance the 
purple born wanted to display to anyone they graced their presence with in the throne room. Nix had been one of the handmaidens who spent three hours with the princess to craft that look. The advantage it conferred her was that she could replicate it with Majorian the next time Livia would vacate the capital.

Boniface sulked in his chair, stabbing his lamb and squeezing every last droplet of blood out of it. Dark shadows were traced under his eyes. It was an unfortunate turn of events that he had his slave drink the well's waters the day after Nix used her special concoction. Fifty Men of the Crucible lost their eyesight in a single of day. The Faith looked for culprits to point their daggers towards.

"You have betrayed us," spat Boniface. Never had Nix taken so much pleasure of seeing this vile man riled up. She hid a smile. It was only the beginning of his torment.


"We had nothing to do with the Faith's infighting, High Cardinal."

"Infighting? The Men of the Crucible's loyalty is not to be questioned, little girl! I have handpicked every one of them!"

Domitian knocked on the round table, his fist almost toppling a sponge cake next to his fiancee. 

"Mind your tongue, Cardinal. You will show my fiancee the respect she deserves."

Livia put two grapes in her mouth. "Who else could have poisoned the well, Cardinal?"

"You people mock me with your condescension. The Underworld will take you all.
Making alliances only to flash your daggers during negotiations. Utterly despicable. Even Molochian heathens are more honorable."

"Have you not considered the most obvious possibility, old man? Claradore. He played you like a harp."

"No one plays the Faith like a harp." He turned towards Majorian who was dressed in a Scholae Palatinae's garb.
"And why do you tolerate that freak in your palace? I know that he is an aberration of nature."

"The man sings well, Cardinal. There is no better singer in the Known World. Let us return to the topic at hand. It is likely a ploy of the Magister Herboraum," said Livia.

"Hah! You want me to believe a man that abhors clothes is intelligent enough to device this stratagem."

"He is not to be underestimated."

Domitian groaned in exasperation. "We squander time here, Livia. The Eastern Army will be grouping here in weeks. Let us use it to smash that half naked man."

"That is our contingency, my love. We have already sent pigeons with the orders."

_So the army gathers at Thanatopolis._

"It seems there is no more need of conversing here. Pray you do not find yourself in our way," said Livia.

"The sword calls the axe sharp."

Domitian snickered. "This is no time for bluffs, Cardinal."

"You idiotic purpleborn. Your empire's decadence is visible to all. Look at all the rot that has taken hold in twenty years of Ralens the Elder's reign. A man exposing his upper body can now waddle in court."  He pointed to Nix. "Heathen Elysians now feed Medeans and unnatural freaks of nature desecrate your holy lands. A storm is coming, one powered by the Goddess' will itself. Purgatory awaits all of you who will be caught in it."
