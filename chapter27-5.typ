The corpse of the girl called Nix was presented to the Emperor in the Hippodrome.
The Excubitores found it during the early hours of the morning. The stench of rotten eggs oozed from the fresh corpse. All entrances to the Hippodrome had been closed off for the day. Scholae Palatinae and Excubitores patrolled the stands, chasing away any bystander who wanted a peek at the dead Magi.

It was quite the spectacle to attend your own autopsy. Physicians including Zhapur were conscripted in determining the cause of death. They stood beneath the shadow of the Hydra Obelisk. The words History is written by the Conquerors were inscribed on the monument, a relic from the ancient Setebet Empire long annexed by the Regnassian Empire.

Nix's visage had been carefully reconstructed by the Red Guild. The poor non-Magi would never suspect to be in presence of a prostitute's corpse. Livia stared at her old self,
finding the face's asymmetry to be irritable. Had her skin been always so dark? It was indeed inconceivable that anyone would find Nix ravishing. Majorian was probably the worst liar the Known World had birthed.

"Your August Majesty, it would seem the girl's bladder has failed her..." said Zhapur, unable to restrain his tears.

"You two were acquaintances, doctor?" asked Livia.

"The Firstborn bless her in the Heavens. Sh-she was an aide and had done much for my clinic. Her and Claradore brought silphium every month."

"The Faith will not tolerate such activities, doctor. You must not mention your connection to this... Nix to anyone else should you value your family's life."

" I did not know that she was a Magi...If she truly was a Magi, she was the kindest I have ever met," His voice cracked. "And I could not save her."

She touched his back. "The girl appreciated your kindness, doctor. I am sure of it."

He buried his nose in his green tunic. "If you permit me, I would like to bury her with Elysian rites."

"That will not be necessary, doctor. The Faith will requisition the body in the afternoon."

Zhapur grunted. "The Faith must not be allowed near her! They will dissect her! Her body will unsuitable to be consumed by the Firstborn's Flames."

"You speak as if we have a choice, doctor."

A Scholae Palatinae ran towards her position.

"Your August Majesty, Cardinal Sextus has come to claim the corpse," he said.

_He is early,_ thought Livia. 

Drums and trumpets roared the distance. Men of the Crucible sang hymns of the Faith. The stomping of boots resonated through the Hippodrome. A column of zealots made its way from the arches. Sextus crouched beneath the entrance. The moment of truth had come.

Livia bowed before the Cardinal.

"Your Holiness. This Magi was discovered by our troops. I believe she matches the description you have provided us."

Sextus did not reply. His scepter echoed a loud thud on the sand every time it struck the ground. He was enrobed in a broad wool coat over a monk's garments. 
Black veins. His thick collar wanted to hide it but it was plain to smell for any Magi. Decay. Like poison seeping beneath his skin, the blackened veins pulsed. How the man managed to walk effortlessly was beyond her comprehension. Every step he took must cause him to wail in pain. His magic was rotting. Livia hid a smile.
Of course, with Serena gone, his source of magic had vanished. Sooner or later, the rot would devour him whole leaving him a husk of a Giant. Sextus was as desperate as the Magi.

Her men stopped all of their actions to look at what the Cardinal would do to Nix's body. As Zhapur said, Sextus would first cut open the stomach and the head for an inspection. However, none of the Men of the Crucible carried a chirurgical kit. The Giant bent down before Nix's corpse. He raised an arm, smelling it with his colossal nostrils. Large tendrils of hair protruded from his nose, revolting Livia and Zhapur. Livia saw that Zhapur's face reddened when Sextus licked Nix's palm. 

It was tempting to imagine one stabbing the Giant on his jugular. Livia could have conjured a blood blade and inserted it into the man's dying throat. How long did he have left? A year? A month? 

The Giant stood up. He turned his titanic frame in her direction.

"The Magi play you for fools," he announced.

Livia feinted surprise. "Y-Y-Your Holiness...I do not understand...Is this not a Magi?"

Sextus pointed his scepter in Nix's way. His voice thundered with the Cants of Vygrawmoth. An amber glow emanated from the tip, spreading to Nix's body. Gasps 
percolated through the Hippodrome. The corpse's face melted, its sun kissed complexion leaving way for a brighter skin tone. A crooked nose was revealed alongside dried lipstick. _It was never going to be simple,_ thought Livia.

"Behold! The vile Magi resorted to a glamor to deceive us!" roared Sextus.

Livia applauded. It was an honest compliment. She would have to resort to more sophisticated trickeries to prevail here. The possibilities raced in her mind.

"Stop the clapping. Do not pretend flattery will mask your incompetence, girl!" hissed Sextus.

"Forgive me, your Holiness, our men are still unfamiliar with the Magi's ways. As you can see, their deception can elude the most intelligent of soldiers and doctors. If only you could enlighten us. All of us work for the same cause. We cannot hope to find the Magi if you withhold valuable information from us."

Sextus snarled. 

"I am surrounded by cretins, am I? The next time you and that bumbling idiot of a brother have a Magi to show me, ensure they are real," he said.

By the time Livia returned to the Palace Complex, her stomach was crippled by a dragon's hunger. She had initially thought that becoming a Purpleborn meant that she would no longer starve. While it was true that she never found herself with an empty plate in the dining room, she had to contend with another issue.

Tonight, she had reserved the table for her and Ordogan only. It had been a month since they had initiated their series of mistakes. For the occasion, Livia chose a flowing rose gown with an amethyst brooch adorning the bodice. Cranberry pies, lobster fried with scallions, ginger and garlic were arrayed in an octagonal table. Vyrmogothian white wine laid on the table to complement the meal. 

A total of five emptied lobster carapaces sat on Livia's porcelain plate.

"I never thought my love had such an appetite," said Ordogan who was careful to pluck every shred of meat from the lobster's claws with his utensils. Livia never bothered with such precision, relying on her hands and teeth to clean the crustaceans.

"The times are stressful for my body. If I am to prevent the monsters from destroying the capital, I cannot be on an empty stomach," said Livia.

Her stomach rumbled. She had calculated that it would take eight lobsters to thwart her hunger. She would have to ask the Artifice to deliver excess food to her room as usual. The servants whispered. Why was the Empress now eating as much as three people in a sitting? How has her waistline tolerated such excesses? 
To quell these unsavory rumors, Livia ordered the Magister Sussurri to flaunt her impeccable sport routine. From polo lessons to swimming in the beach behind the Palace Complex, the Empress had to be presented as a model in physical activities. Surely that would convince the handmaidens on why Livia could gobble an entire pie by herself.

Ordogan's fork scraped the lobster's feet. 

"Perhaps it would be wise to consult a physician, my love. Such a voracious appetite cannot be good for your health," said Ordogan.

"I have heard the opposite from Zhapur. It is a sudden loss of appetite that is most worrying for doctors."

"Your habits have also changed. Milk did not used to make you vomit."

_Perceptive yet troublesome,_ thought Livia.

"It is my time of the month. Such changes are expected," lied Livia.

In truth, there was more to that. Her old self also disliked food laced with peppers. Livia had once mocked her for her inability to even lick a black pepper
while she was able to swallow two simultaneously. This was no longer the case. 
In addition, she had acquired a refined taste for sweets and wine. Her tongue was now capable of pin pointing the concentration of sugar in a bite of cake or even assert the acidity of wine with clinical accuracy. _The perks of being a Purpleborn,_ thought Livia.

"I did not think such biological changes could be induced by that..." said Ordogan.

"You have yet to understand a woman's biology, my love," said Livia.

"The men have told me about the Magi we found in the Hippodrome. They say her name was Nix...She was the girl that came with Claradore eight years ago. Both of them came from Miroconium. Perhaps it would be wise to investigate the ruins of the village. An opening to the Gates of the Underworld could be there."

"There is no opening there, my love."

Ordogan dropped his fork. "How are you certain?"

"I had spoken to this Nix in the year prior to her demise. The village is a hellhole. The Goddess did us a kindness by flooding it."

"You surprise me, Livia. I thought you had no love for Elysian handmaidens."

"They have their uses. Nothing else. Nothing more. We can learn much about the Emperor of Kings. Information is power after all."

Ordogan smiled softly. Livia saw pride in his brown eyes.

"I am glad, my love. Forgive me for doubting your sincerity. You have truly matured in the recent weeks. You are no longer a princess in an empress' garb. Instead, the vestments now suit you."

Livia blushed. This warranted another mistake this evening.

"You are too kind. It is only through trial that we forge ourselves," said Livia.

"My son has spoken to me about our liaison. He hopes we do not provide him a sibling," said Ordogan.

Livia had seen Theodosius once in her lifetime. The boy had been unlucky, having not inherited his father's talents in martial arts. He compensated by being an excellent scholar in philosophy. Had his father and her been more careful in evading mistakes, Ordogan would have likely proposed a marriage between Theodosius and Livia. 

"We have taken all precautions necessary," said Livia. Or rather, she had taken all of the necessary countermeasures.

The Goddess damned silphium. She had never thought she would reach the age where instead of administering the plant, she would be the recipient. The morning after every mistake with Ordogan, the Artifice would provide her the concoction. It smelled like Baba. It was the only aspect she loved of the entire ordeal.

Her tongue and throat would boil as soon as she ingested it. Sweat and tears escaped her visage. Her entire body would convulse on the floor. Her teeth gnawed at her bed sheet. The Faith must not know. It was as if her entire being was burned alive at the pyre. Her back arched almost unnaturally. Arms and wrists contorted violently. Worse of all, the blood that belonged to Nix wanted to flee her body at all costs. Livia had to restrain it. Learning from every person who had been at Baba's house, Livia always used the restroom before swallowing the silphium. It would mitigate the damage to her belongings.

The searing pain would always reach a climax around ten minutes. By this time, she could not breathe. Livia's teeth tore through her bed sheet akin to savage wolf loosened on a deer's corpse. She grunted ferociously. The throbbing agony would then slowly subside. Her heart rate would slow down. She would listen to sweat dripping down on the marble floor.

The pain was a necessity. Ordogan's heart and mind had been conquered at this stage and the Medean army along with him. One of these days, the silphium will not be necessary. Once the situation with Sextus was resolved, she was on a faster track to provide a heir than her brother. And a child from a Magi and the Lion of the East would eclipse any of her brother's offspring.
