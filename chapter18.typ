Nix woke up, flailing in what appeared to a bed. Instead of seeing Serena’s face, she was disappointed to be greeted by Claradore’s Artifice. Never had she thought its lurid appearance would relieve her. Her arms billowed with burn marks. Phoenix feathers had been placed on the blisters. An throbbing pain dug into her skin.

"So, it seems you will live, my dear," cawed the Artifice.

That was not reassuring. the thing called Serena had hovered in the air, winds had howled around her white wings. The pillar of light had come, its deafening metallic sound still ringing in her ears. At that moment, all of her instincts culminated in one simple decision. Flee.

"Where are we?" Nix rasped. The room had all the attributes of a wine cellar, empty amphoras littering the corners. Paintings of spiders, some unfinished, were stacked in an unorderly pile. A small altar dedicated to the True Goddess stood in front of her bed, the deity having being painted in an amateurish manner.

"The very beginning, my dear. Where I had started my life in this new world," said the Artifice.

"Will he find us?"

"In the long term, yes. In the short term, no."

"He was a Giant."

The Artifice bit a pear with its human teeth. "I am aware of that."

"And you never bothered to inform me?"

"You know the stories. It is hard to believe that one of them still lived, my dear."

"And Serena, the Goddess? You also knew."

"Her intentions had always been a riddle."
