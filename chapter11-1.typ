Alone, Serena unlocked Nix’ medallion, confirming its mundane contents. She closed the ornament, tying it up around a dove’s neck. #emph[The die is cast.]

"You know what needs to be done," she said to the bird as it departed the windows of her room.

Unwanted toys should be parted with. Another child’s dirt was another’s gold. That was the advice she had given to that boy on his father’s deathbed.

Death of royalty invited melodrama. The purple born were the unwilling participants of a masked ball who hid their faces behind grief. See the prince, Ralens the Younger, his father’s crown ill-fitting his head. He wore this mask of tears as he deposited a wreath of violets on the Emperor’s body.

This mask of tears was but a transparent veil. The boy would sit on a throne on the morrow and be imprisoned in the loneliest profession in the Known World.

Nix sulked next to Serena. Humor had proven ineffective today. Within a week, Nix would forget about it. A child like her should not have been given that toy.

The site for his masked carnival was the Palace Complex’s mausoleum, whose construction failed to mirror the talent of the Magi. The entrance’s tympana, lined with lapis lazuli and emerald tiles exposed an octagonal platform where the imperial catafalque stood. No floating lanterns, no obelisks with inscriptions releasing an incandescent glow at night, no dragon bones buried with their rider. All architecture succeeding the Age of Magic continued this trend of over simplicity. It was expected. Children could not hope to match the masterworks of adults. In addition, this simplicity allowed Serena’eyes to focus on the children hosting the masked ball.

"A ruler has officially two faces for the realm: a public one, a mask for the Known World to behold, the second, a private one for close friends and the women he beds. Yet there exists a third one, one whose existence is only known to the emperor himself and glimpsed only in the reflection of the mirror’s gaze. Once that mask was uncovered, a ruler’s weakness was revealed and the weak... The weak get beaten," Claradore had always repeated to Nix. It was one of the few times Serena had agreed with him.

Ralens the Younger coiled himself in Nix’ arms. His crown slid from his head, ricocheting on the mosaic floor. Serena caught it in her hands. The diadem’s rubies reflected the painful fresco adorning the ceiling. It was that day.

Her bloody spear had pierced his breastplate. The lone child did not scream. He collapsed, his eyes as adorable as they had been when she had birthed him. #emph[My baby boy. I am killing my baby boy.] Magic had been but futile when the Gatekeeper called for his soul. Her bloodied hands listened to his fleeting heartbeat, his gargling blood dooming her miserable attempt at parenthood.

Around her, men had roared her name. Her name, which they had usurped. Her name which they had used to shy away from responsibility. Her name which was now synonymous with kinslaying. #emph[Erfan, I...]

With the strength of despair, she had lifted his body, the men rejoicing in the murder of her son. A mistake that could not be undone. Rebel trumpets rang on the battlefield. Her wings sprouted, carrying this toll, this boulder, this leech that would feed at her inner thoughts for the next summers of her childless life. Her men alluded to enemy reinforcements. Serena flew away from the smell of guts and blood. Beneath her, the men she once called traitors swarmed the men she had once called her followers. This war her hands had started was no longer hers. The Gates Hel had awaited her first visit.

Medean horns announced the coming of the princess Livia and her consort Domitian, lovers dancing on a house of dominos chasing after the thrill of perfection. Under the sphinx mask Livia wore laid this green visage every time her impassible face watched her brother’s crown. A purple dress embroidered with phoenixes was her choice of attire. Serena glanced at Nix who had the guilty pleasure of borrowing the princess’ sumptuous clothes and perfume in her absence. When enrobed in purple, Nix became the pearl in the oyster that was the Known World. Serena’s pearl which she had polished after acquiring it from The Nameless Slave.

The Nameless Slave, the one Nix oddly called Baba, had entertained an egregious amount of fallacies when Nix had entered her care. A wonderful dove such as the last Magi was not warranted to be kept in a cage. Birds never thrived in such neglect. But who was Serena to lambast the parenting methods of a Nameless Slave? The elderly child would always remind Serena of her own inadequacies, of Erfan. In the end, both Serena and the Nameless Slave had proven their worthlessness. When the Nameless Slave’s house had been razed by the lawless children, Serena had been perched in a tree, watching as Nix could finally deploy her wings. How many times had Nix and Serena played the prince and the accomplice with Serena rescuing her from the imaginary dragons. In their pretend world, Serena would be the prince who wielded Regnant’s legendary sword. Nix, the simple companion, would tend to the horses, sharpen Serena’s weapons and cook splendid pastries. Together, they could triumph over any monsters drawn by Nix’ imagination. And such were her dreams, dreams that she has never had in years, dreams that she had forgotten to be possible or plausible. To be a prince for Nix.

Another set of Medean horns, followed by a troupe of flutes and lyres heralded Claradore’s arrival in the mausoleum. As with his usual appearances, he entered the scene bereft of any cloth on his upper body much to the bloodshot eyes of Domitian. A male and a female bedmates holding his arm saluted all occupants of the mausoleum. This capricious child even maintained that habit during the cold winter months, a folly even for someone of Serena’s age.

"My Prince, your father has bestowed me the honor of reading his will."

"Magister Militum. I-I. The crown is a burden that I cannot shoulder."

Ralens the Younger picked the diadem from Serena’s arms. He knelt before Claradore, raising the crown in his hands.

"Please, as the man who saved me and my sister from certain demise during the Plague of Anastasian, may you lead this country and may your reign be as long and prosperous as Sarvitar the Great."

A delectable turn of events. Serena scoured the room for the equally succulent reactions. Domitian clenched his fists. Livia bit her nails, blood leaking from her fingers.

Claradore picked up the diadem, this unreadable gaze analyzing the piece he had probably long coveted. Nix held Serena’s hands. Serena squeezed hers, holding the illusion that she supported this course of action. Magi who craved for purple were the most dangerous. Through this greed for domination, they had conjured wars, plagues and natural disasters out of thin air. The Age of Magic could only be undone by Magi themselves for only they could sink continents and devour cities in vortexes of flames, hail and darkness. With the Magi extinct, the world had been saved from apocalyptic destruction.

"Magister Herboraum, the empire needs an emperor whose prowess in battle is unmatched. Elysian savages and Rauthengardian barbarians are amassing at the borders...Only I can inspire fear in our enemies, " said Domitian. Livia elbowed him.

"Forgive my fiancé, this conundrum is better left to the Goddess. A new Cardinal will be arriving at the capital soon. His guidance would be invaluable to us," said Livia.

"My dear purpleborn, you all forget the principles of kingmaking."

"Kingmaking? You were the Emperor’s confidant, milord. It is logical that the crown would belong to you," said Serena.

Claradore shook his head. "The army. Who does it answer to?"

"Does it matter, milord?"

"Ordogan. Someone has not been paying attention," answered Nix.

"Elysian! You dare snicker at me!" said Domitan grabbing the hilt of his ceremonial sword. Livia put her arm in front of his chest.

As if summoned by Nix herself, Ordogan entered the mausoleum. The unruly children in the room shut their mouth as this Molochian child placed a composite bow on the Emperor’s body. His body rigidified itself as it made the imperial salute. Serena looked at Nix. When the former was unaware that Ordogan was married, she had this outrageous fantasy of having him as her prince.

Nix stayed silent, fidgeting with her fingers. The girl could not wait to soar the skies above the capital to search for her missing object.

In a moment worthy of Medean history books, Claradore placed the crown back on Ralens the Younger’s head. Serena saw that even Livia could not restrain her relief. Ordogan bent the knee.

"Your August Majesty, the crown belongs to those who do not seek it," he said as he bowed before his liege. Nix clapped. All occupants of the mausoleum knelt. Serena caught Claradore’s eye. Both smirked at one another. The significance of that was not lost to either. The day would come sooner than expected.
