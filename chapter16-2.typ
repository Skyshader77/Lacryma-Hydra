Serena laid on a cloud, letting the frothy texture rustle her hair. Storks and dove flew past her improvised bed. Her stomach grumbled. The last time she had indulged in such inner withdrawal was following Erfan's death. She remembered spending a month in the skies, drinking only condensation.  Serena had deserved this starvation for she had slain her own son.
These bloodstained hands had seen their last victim. And so she had hoped to find herself at the Gates of Underworld. Every day she found herself awake was a testament to her failure at redeeming herself. Thing had changed in a millennium.
Magi had returned. And more importantly, the one she had betrayed rose from the dead.

Serena yearned to make amends, to relive the nights of passion she and sister had 
lived before their parents separated them. Yet her sister's incarnation was now enamored with this being called Majorian. The eccentricities in Nix's preferences only made her more desirable. Why had the Gatekeeper taunted her this way with Nix's return? 

Never had Serena forgotten the day she ignited the Last War of the Magi. She had found her sister and Regnant in a loving embrace without their clothes. This incarnation of Nix did not even flinch as Serena turned her into a monstrous spider. This woke the unknowing Regnant whose scream pealed through the Library of Athenaeum. Serena came to the rescue of the prince, casting incandescent geometries that blinded the room. Fire cracked. A hiss like none has ever seen 
shook the towers of manuscripts and magical books. Explosion after explosion rocked the ancient compound. By the time her light subsided, both Nix and the Library of Athenaeum were no more. She flew in the dark bellied clouds with Regnant in her loving arms. 

And there Serena stood where the floating Library of Athenaeum once was. Thousands of the Magi's tomes probably littered the seafloor under Thanatopolis. Maybe one of them could explain the Giant's actions. Why did that Giant come here?

Paradise had come to an end. They had to flee. 

Nix, Majorian and Claradore may believe that they had achieved the elusive heroic victory: a single bloodless swipe against both the Faith and the princess. Yet Serena knew that they had only managed to conjure a typhoon of immeasurable suffering. The Giant was here. The Faith is acutely aware of the presence of Magi.
The only question that remained was why the Faith was content to let Nix poison their well. Perhaps like her, the Faith had become nonchalant. All blades ended up rusting.

Serena closed her eyes. She sensed the faint trace of incense amidst the salty air. Incense? She was far from the Faith's churches. No, he had come.

She reopened her eyes. His colossal frame stood behind her. He had been named The Heightless by his own kind, a dwarf to the race of Giants. It was this reason that he joined her cause a thousand years ago. 

His elongated beard could touch the floor despite his height. A scarlet cape reaching down the elbows covered his white cassock. The day she granted him immortality was drawn in great detail over the cape. 

"You have not changed, First Cardinal," said Serena.

"Goddess," said Sixtus as he bowed before her. It was a title she had long 
tried to erase from her memory.

"I thought you had disavowed me. Am I to believe you have finally learned forgiveness?"

"Return with me to Metarexia. The world needs its Goddess."

"So you tire of that poor girl that now wears my title? Have I not warned you? This religion...It was all a mistake."

"A mistake? It unified the Known Word! The people turn to the Goddess, you, for guidance. How can you keep let them live in uncertainty? With you, we saw how easy their minds bend to peace when the threat of eternal damnation looms above their head."

It was as if a thousand years had not passed between them. The only two remaining adults in the Known World could never reconcile. Serena had thought the disappearance of magic from this world would end all wars. To her chagrin, mankind had proved creative in finding all sorts of casus belli to clash steel. 
From natural resources to the most insignificant theological detail, older children sent younger ones to die in a faraway battlefield. It was heartbreaking to watch from her throne in Metarexia as countless generations of children never learned the mistakes of their predecessors. They said history often repeated itself. Artists would say history always rhymed like verses of a classical poem.

"Your man, Boniface, has murdered the Nameless Slave. I was disappointed. Without her, you would not be able to ascend the skies," said Serena.

"She has served her purpose and is no longer needed. You were there were you not? You chose to let things be. The bystander cannot complain of injustice."

Serena groaned. "It is impossible for one being to remove all the pain and suffering in this world."

"Are you not the Goddess? You have the power and will to forge a paradise out of this cruel realm where babes are killed in their crib by disease."

"If I could have saved them, I would have."

Sixtus pointed his finger at her. It was as lengthy as a chair's leg. "Then, you enjoy all of it, do you? The suffering? The wars? The plague? You do not eliminate the causes of extreme pain because you find joy in apathy."

Pragmatic and cruel just as she remembered him.

"A Goddess does not trouble herself with the living. The children of this world must learn to walk their own path."

He chuckled. "It is tiring indeed to do nothing while the world rots around you. You feint innocence and ignorance. Magi have returned, and you have done all but ensure their destruction."

"Is it not the duty of the First Cardinal to slay Magi? Or has the test of time taken its toll on you too, Sixtus."

"One of Magi is the splitting image of your sister. Do you understand what this means for us?"

_The Apocalypse is before us,_ thought Serena.

"We cannot precipitate a course of action based on coincidences," said Serena.

"There are no coincidences nor chance when it comes to the Magi. You of all people should know that. The Apocalyse has come. The Gatekeeper has already initiated it. That Magi will be our undoing. Yet, she ...is your friend."

Sixtus's accusatory glare spat venom at her. His breath stank of both sulfur and incense. 

"I have done the necessary preparations. My course of action is codependent on yours. Will you oppose me, you who have mingled with the Magi for all these years? "

She yawned. Yet there stood a Giant who had served her for decades, no centuries. She had lost the ability to present a mask in front of him. She could only hope that he had forgotten how to read through her lips. "The Magi are of no concern and will be dealt with in due time."

He cackled, exhibiting his yellow crooked teeth. Zealotry oozed out of his every breath. Serena did not think it possible for such religious fervor to descend into madness. But at the end of their last dance, hatred laid bare in his defeated eyes. She should have executed him then. The last time they had crossed blades, she left him as a husk of a Giant, arms and legs broken under the collapsing Temple of Holy Redemption. Why had she not sent it to the Gates of the Underworld? She saw not the zealot he had become but the crying small Giant languishing about his height. He and the Nameless Slave were the last person to have known her before her godhood. Instead, she had left Metarexia, never to return.

"What are those Magi to you? Are they truly worth risking the return of slave armies? You would let this word end and return to the shackles of magic?" spat Sixtus. 
He rolled his sleeves.

"Two Magi can hardly imprison anyone," lied Serena.

"A dragon in a sea of sheep is still a dragon. That child, Claradore, he knows what I am. The time to strike is now."

He waved his hand.

"So it is true. You have deserted us. Heed my warning then. The Magi must be destroyed. Stand in my way, and you will see that I have learned from my mistakes," said Sixtus.

"The disciple bluffs in front of the Goddess. Return to Metarexia, First Cardinal while you still can. This time, I will not grant you the privilege of mercy."

She stood up. From the depths of sorcerous bruise, a light dissipated the clouds around her. The fool. He would dare test her resolve. Serpents of thunder were conjured from his palms, the Lost Spells of Iruel. She cursed, her lips pronouncing cants of flames. Her wings emerged. Roaring dragonheads manifested from her body, colliding with his lightning. Explosions rippled through the firmament. A never-ending rain-world started beneath them. 

As their spells watered down, they stood before each other as they did a millennium ago. Sixtus shed his clothes. Tattoos of forgone scriptures from the incantations of Ulmar to the Grimoire of Red were plastered all over his tall 
frame. They shimmied, a hydra of thunderbolts enveloped his being. She trusted with a blood lance. The impact sent her barreling in the sky. Jolts of pain seared her abdomen and her legs. With mesmerizing agility, Sixtus leaped after all, his left hand grabbing her by the throat. 
His right hand formed a blood blade that flirted with her throat.

"The student has surpassed the master," simply said Sixtus.

"So you would slay your mentor like the Magi before you," rasped Serena.

"No, I am not a cruel man. You have shown me mercy a thousand years ago. This will be the only mercy I will grant you. Leave for the Unknown World. Let those who wish to stop the Apocalypse do their work."

He threw her atop a nimbus. She spat out blood. When was the last time she had tasted her own blood? Erfan had been the last child to have reminded her of her own mortality. She wanted to laugh. The Goddess bleeding? The Goddess herself defeated? Claradore and Nix would be ecstatic. 

Sixtus had vanished by the time she could scour her surroundings again.

In the distance she peered a bird with a human head. It sneered atrociously before flying away. Sixtus and now this. Nix would have said that the complexity of her predicament had increased exponentially. Serena would have agreed. The day had come.
