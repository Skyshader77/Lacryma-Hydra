Serena laid on a cloud, letting the frothy texture rustle her hair. Storks and dove flew past her improvised bed. Her stomach grumbled. The last time she had indulged in such inner withdrawal was following Erfan's death. She remembered spending a month in the skies, drinking only condensation.  Serena had deserved this starvation for she had slain her own son.
These bloodstained hands had seen their last victim. And so she had hoped to find herself at the Gates of Underworld. Every day she found herself awake was a testament to her failure at redeeming herself. Thing had changed in a millennium.
Magi had returned. And more importantly, the one she had betrayed rose from the dead.

Serena yearned to make amends, to relive the nights of passion she and sister had 
lived before their parents separated them. Yet her sister's incarnation was now enamored with this being called Majorian. The eccentricities in Nix's preferences only made her more desirable. Why had the Gatekeeper taunted her this way with Nix's return? 

Never had Serena forgotten the day she ignited the Last War of the Magi. She had found her sister and Regnant in a loving embrace without their clothes. This incarnation of Nix did not even flinch as Serena turned her into a monstrous spider. This woke the unknowing Regnant whose scream pealed through the Library of Athenaeum. Serena came to the rescue of the prince, casting incandescent geometries that blinded the room. Fire cracked. A hiss like none has ever seen 
shook the towers of manuscripts and magical books. Explosion after explosion rocked the ancient compound. By the time her light subsided, both Nix and the Library of Athenaeum were no more. She flew in the dark bellied clouds with Regnant in her loving arms. 

And there Serena stood where the floating Library of Athenaeum once was. Thousands of the Magi's tomes probably littered the seafloor under Thanatopolis. Maybe one of them could explain the Giant's actions. Why did that Giant come here?

Paradise had come to an end. They had to flee. 

Nix, Majorian and Claradore may believe that they had achieved the elusive heroic victory: a single bloodless swipe against both the Faith and the princess. Yet Serena knew that they had only managed to conjure a typhoon of immeasurable suffering. The Giant was here. The Faith is acutely aware of the presence of Magi.
The only question that remained was why the Faith was content to let Nix poison their well. Perhaps like her, the Faith had become nonchalant. All blades ended up rusting.

Serena closed her eyes. She sensed the faint trace of incense amidst the salty air. Incense? She was far from the Faith's churches. No, he had come.

She reopened her eyes. His colossal frame stood behind her. He had been named The Heightless by his own kind, a dwarf to the race of Giants. It was this reason that he joined her cause a thousand years ago. 

"You have not changed, Alexander," said Serena.

"Goddess," said Alexander as he bowed before her.

"I thought you had disavowed me. Am I to believe you have finally learned forgiveness?"

"Return with me to Metarexia. The world needs its Goddess."

"So you tire of that poor girl that now wears my title? Have I not warned you? This religion...It was all a mistake."

"A mistake? It unified the Known Word! The people turn to the Goddess, you, for guidance. How easy their minds bend to peace when the threat of eternal damnation looms above their head."

It was as if a thousand years had not passed between them. The only two remaining adults in the Known World could never reconcile.

"Your man, Boniface, has murdered the Nameless Slave. I was disappointed. Without her, you would not be able to ascend the skies," said Serena.

"She has served her purpose and is no longer needed. You were there were you not? You chose to let things be."

Pragmatic and cruel just as she remembered him.

"A Goddess does not trouble herself with the living."

He chuckled. "It is tiring indeed to do nothing while the world rots around you. You feint innocence and ignorance. Magi have returned, and you have done all but ensured their destruction."

"Is it not the duty of the Goddess' Hand to slay Magi? Or have the test of time taken its toll on you too, Alexander."

"My course of action is codependent on yours. Will you oppose me, you who have mingled with the Magi for all these years? "

She yawned. Yet there stood a Giant who had served her for decades, no centuries. She had lost the ability to present a mask in front of him. She could only hope that he had forgotten how to read through her lips. "The Magi are of no concern and will be dealt with in due time."

He cackled, exhibiting his yellow crooked teeth. Zealotry oozed out of his every breath. Serena did not think it possible for such religious fervor to descend into madness. But at the end of their last dance, hatred laid bare in his defeated eyes. She should have executed him then. Instead, she had left Metarexia, never to return.

"What are those Magi to you? Are they truly worth risking the return of slave armies? You would let this word return to the shackles of magic?"

"Two Magi can hardly imprison anyone," lied Serena.

"A dragon in a sea of sheep is still a dragon. That child, Claradore, he knows what I am. The time to strike is now."

He waved his hand.

"So it is true. You have deserted us. Heed my warning then. The Magi must be destroyed. Stand in my way, and you will see that I have learned from my mistakes," said Alexander.

"The disciple bluffs in front of the Goddess. Return to Metarexia, Disciple while you still can. This time, I will not grant you the privilege of mercy."

In the distance she peered a bird with a human head flying away. The day had come.
