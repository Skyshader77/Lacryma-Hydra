An ocean of pavilions flooded the Medean countryside. Phoenix, hydra and wyrm banners flew in the grasslands. The smell of sizzling meat and deglazing permeated the air. The ground beneath her was soft and wet. Octagonal tents were erected within a palisade wall, some as large as houses. It seemed the entire field was turned into a canvass of gold, white and red. 

Horses caparisoned in silver and gold were led into the enclave in case she wished to participate in a polo session with the cataphracts. 

In total, 10 000 men had been amassed under Ordogan's command. 
She rode behind the general as they approached the camp's gate.
They were aghast to be greeted by a Man of the Crucible.

"Cardinal Sextus demands your presence," said the Man of the Crucible, a boy no more than seventeen summers.

Demand. Demand. So this was how the Cardinal treated the nations of the Known World: as his vassal state. Livia glanced at the other camp that the Men of the Crucible had built. An asymmetrical construction defiled her eyes. No watchtowers.
Men sitting down with their swords in their dominant hands or urinating on the palisade. The Faith had sent 15 000 Men of the Crucible in search of Nix and Claradore and expected Thanatopolis' populace to feed their host.

Livia and Ralens heard innumerable petitions about the unsavory behavior of the Faith's army from squires stealing chickens and lambs to men hunting women in packs. The price of grain and fish had more than quadrupled since the Faith's legions arrived. Search for the Magi they said. All Livia saw were drunken men loitering around the capital's streets.

_Patience. By the end of month, I will have 40 000 men here,_ thought Livia.

Ordogan wheeled his horse. They sashayed among the soldiers who were playing children card games in the Medean camp. 

They found Sextus in his tent sawing a deer's stomach with a blood blade.
Every innard was meticulously removed from the slain animal.

"Your Holiness requested our presence," said Livia.

Sextus opened his giant palm.  An amalgam of crushed bones and feathers could be found inside. What used to be the Artifice's skull laid in a thousand pieces. Livia shrieked, clinging to Ordogan's shoulders. She averted her gaze. There was no true danger. Claradore could just vacate the Artifice and craft a new one.

"W-What is that?" stammered Livia.

"An Artifice, your August Majesty. A Magi's soul once resided inside," said 
Sextus.

"What a horrible sight," said Ordogan.

"This is the undeniable proof that the Magi are still loose in this city."

Ordogan subtly glared at the Cardinal. The longer the Faith and their white tents 
camped outside Thanatopolis, the further it eroded the prestige of the Medean army. The people must be allowed to think that the crown fears men that have not shed blood in centuries.

"Why have they not left? Can't they see that our combined might is irresistible? By the end of the month 40 000 troops will be billeted in the city and its surroundings," said Livia. 40 000 against 10 000 Men of the Crucible and one Giant. Livia was starting to appreciate her odds.

"My hypothesis is that one of them is gravely wounded. They are using leeches brought from the Underworld to reconstitute themselves."

"The leeches from the Underworld? So resurrection is not just a fairy tale," 
said Ordogan.

Livia pressed her luck. "How can we locate those leeches?"

"They typically reside at the boundaries of the living and the dead. All the gateways connecting this world to the Underworld were closed a thousand years ago."

_So he does not know where to find Claradore,_ thought Livia.
