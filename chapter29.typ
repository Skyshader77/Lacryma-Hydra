An ocean of pavilions flooded the Medean countryside. Phoenix, hydra and wyrm banners flew in the grasslands. The smell of sizzling meat and deglazing permeated the air. The ground beneath her was soft and wet. Octagonal tents were erected within a palisade wall, some as large as houses. It seemed the entire field was turned into a canvass of gold, white and red. 

Horses caparisoned in silver and gold were led into the enclave in case she wished to participate in a polo session with the cataphracts. 

Above, Margrub Dogas shrieked in the skies. She was pleased to find that her 
men no longer shat themselves upon hearing the creatures' unholy voices. 
Even Ordogan no longer blinked when seeing one. For the past weeks, Livia 
had insisted that Medean infantrymen be posted as close as possible to the monsters. The more one spent next to those things, the less magical they became.

In total, 10 000 men had been amassed under Ordogan's command. 
She rode behind the general as they approached the camp's gate.
They were aghast to be greeted by a Man of the Crucible.

"Cardinal Sextus demands your presence," said the Man of the Crucible, a boy no more than seventeen summers.

Demand. Demand. So this was how the Cardinal treated the nations of the Known World: as his vassal state. Livia glanced at the other camp that the Men of the Crucible had built. An asymmetrical construction defiled her eyes. No watchtowers.
Men sitting down with their swords in their dominant hands or urinating on the palisade. The Faith had sent 15 000 Men of the Crucible in search of Nix and Claradore and expected Thanatopolis' populace to feed their host.

Livia and Ralens heard innumerable petitions about the unsavory behavior of the Faith's army from squires stealing chickens and lambs to men hunting women in packs. The price of grain and fish had more than quadrupled since the Faith's legions arrived. Search for the Magi they said. All Livia saw were drunken men loitering around the capital's streets.

Thanatopolis was afraid. Cults were forming around the rumor that Sextus would raze the city with his Marghrub Dogas. The week before, riots had erupted, forcing her to double the grain tax on Noein. The Faith's churches had grievously suffered much to her delight. It took the appearance of Cardinal Sextus himself to calm the crowd into submission.
During that brief turmoil, it was imperative that the rioters were hoarded away from the Alchemist's Guild.

When the time for battle came, who would actually stand and defend their home? There were 500 000 citizens but among them 150 000 were Faithful. Of the 10 000 Vigiles the city could muster, less than half would not wet themselves on a true battlefield. Livia had gold. Mercenaries were on the table. Yet she was aware of how unreliable these could be.

_Patience. By the end of month, I will have 40 000 men here,_ thought Livia.

Ordogan wheeled his horse. They sashayed among the soldiers who were playing children card games in the Medean camp. 

They found Sextus in his tent as large as the Medean throneroom, sawing a deer's stomach with a blood blade.
Every innard was meticulously removed from the slain animal. Bloodstained plates were arrayed on an octogonal table. 

"Your Holiness requested our presence," said Livia.

Sextus rummaged through the interior of his tent. Scores of books littered the room. Livia picked one in her hands. It was Sextus' handwriting. She did not know the Giant was an avid writer. The prose...Oh the prose was horrid. Metaphors that espoused complexity instead of beauty obstructed every line of text. All of the words were used to elevate the Goddess' beauty. Livia stopped reading at the lines describing Serena's body in great detail. _How nauseating,_ Livia thought.

"I did not know you and the Goddess were friends. How did you two meet?" said Livia.

"Friends? A word she used to torture me with from the day she rescued me from my own kin." He looked at her confused eyes. "I see. There is no more utility in maintaining this pretense of normality." He snapped his fingers. Mist seemed to condense around his large fingers. The fabric of a fine cage unveiled itself before Livia and Ordogan. It was visible to the naked eyes. Rays of light traversed the thin cage, distorting itself akin to a looking glass. _There lies the secret,_ thought Livia. Such was the art of bending reality to one's will. Sextus traced the contour of the cage with his elongated nail. With a simple touch of his hand, he pushed. The cage shattered quietly. No debris fell.

Ordogan and the Excubitores bellowed screams of horror.

"A-A-A- GIANT!" screamed Ordogan. The Exubitores raised their lances, forming a shield wall.

"Another relic from the Age of Magic greets us it seems," said Livia.

"H-How can you st-stay calm, my love? Stay behind me!"

"We have seen Magi and Magrub Dogas. And now Giants. Nothing surprises me anymore. Tell me, Giant, why have you betrayed your own kind?"

"I was called the Sextus the Small by my own kind. The other Giants had no love for someone lacking in height. Even my own mother had nothing but scorn for me. The Giants. They can all go through the Gates of the Underworld," said Sextus.

"Was your pride that fickle?" asked Livia.

"What do you know about pride, girl? My own kind would have condemned me to a life of servitude if the Goddess had not arrived in my village. I was meant for greater purposes."

"Such as slayer of Magi babes?"

"Mock me all you want, girl. This Empire would not exist if it weren't for me. All nations of the Known World owe me for their success."

"Understandable. So it is true...The one who taught the Goddess how to wield lightning bolts..."

"Lightning is the creed and the pride of the Giants. My father taught the Goddess how to channel lightning. I have only watched as they danced before me. She was a prize I could never have."

_And she repaid the favor by wiping all of your kind,_ thought Livia.

"It is admirable that you have held your piety in the face of lust, Cardinal."

"There is no honor in restraint, little girl. All of what I have done was in Her name. Has she ever given me recognition? Never! I obeyed without question and molded this world in her image."

"Molded this world?"

His voice was as cold as a spear tip. "The kingdoms of Atika, Norseum, Karaskand and many more...I have crushed them all. The fools thought it plausible to defy godhood. While the Goddess copulated with Regnant the Dragonslayer, I united the Known World in Her name. I bore sins for her so that the world only saw goodness in her."

Ordogan held the pommel of his sword. Livia elbowed him.

"The Magi's babes...The Gospel tells us they all died in the Great Fire of Xephon..." said Ordogan. Livia detected that she was weighting every word of that sentence.

"I shouldered the burden. It was not appropriate for the Goddess to soil her hands."

"Where is the Goddess? Why does she not assist you in this search for the Magi?" asked Livia.

"The Goddess...is at Metarexia..."

The air felt heavier once he has uttered these words. Ordogan and Livia quickly glanced at each other. Another one was now privy to the truth she and Claradore had known forever. Pages will record this conversation and disseminate the contents to the populace.

"I trust you did not summon us to reminisce about your past, Cardinal," said Livia.

Sextus returned to his guests, holding something in his enormous hands.

He opened his giant palm.  An amalgam of crushed bones and feathers could be found inside. What used to be the Artifice's skull laid in a thousand pieces.
The Aritfice legs still moved. 

"The Magi...Will...Return...," croaked the destroyed Artifice with a disembowed voice.

Livia shrieked, clinging to Ordogan's shoulders. She averted her gaze. There was no true danger. Claradore could just vacate the Artifice and craft a new one.

"W-What in the Goddess' name is that?" stammered Livia.

"An Artifice, your August Majesty. A Magi's soul once resided inside," said 
Sextus.

"What a horrible sight," said Ordogan.

"This is the undeniable proof that the Magi are still loose in this city."

"What more tricks can those Magi produce?" said Livia.

"At this stage, it is fair to assume both of the Magi we seek are on their last legs. The Elysian Magi I have fought was burned from head to toes. She would have had to seek hospice. I have scoured all hospitals. None of them admitted such a patient."

"And the other Magi? The man named Claradore who posed as a healer at our court?
Have you not engaged him as well?"

"I did and I fought the third Magi as well..."

"We saw the body...Who was she?" asked Livia.

Sextus laughed.

"A woman who believed herself to be the Goddess...You do not need to trouble yourself with the Magi we slay. They are not human but slavers."

"A Magi playing at divinity. What a curious creature. Why would one pretend to be their own destroyer?"

"The second Magi oft wear faces that are not their own. The second one we hunt can slip inside rats and cats, make puppets of them. My men have slaughtered thousands of vermin in the city."

Livia's throat tightened.

"It chills my blood to think of such power. If beasts can be vessels, can... can men?"

"You are wise to question how far their gifts extend. Fortune smiles on us: the Magi follow an ancient compact. They are bound by their own laws. No one escapes the old magic and its price. Bind yourself to a human host and you risk your identity for blood can mingle."

"What makes you think a cornered Magi would honor any law?"

"I know their kind well, girl. Pride is their weakness. Always has been."

Ordogan subtly glared at the Cardinal. The longer the Faith and their white tents 
camped outside Thanatopolis, the further it eroded the prestige of the Medean army. The people must be allowed to think that the crown fears men that have not shed blood in centuries.

"Why have they not left? Can't they see that our combined might is irresistible? By the end of the month 40 000 troops will be billeted in the city and its surroundings," said Livia. 40 000 against 10 000 Men of the Crucible and one Giant. Livia was starting to appreciate her odds.

"My hypothesis is that one of them is gravely wounded. They are using leeches brought from the Underworld to reconstitute themselves."

"The leeches from the Underworld? So resurrection is not just a fairy tale," 
said Ordogan.

Livia pressed her luck. "How can we locate those leeches?"

"They typically reside at the boundaries of the living and the dead. All the gateways connecting this world to the Underworld were closed a thousand years ago."

_So he does not know where to find Claradore,_ thought Livia.
