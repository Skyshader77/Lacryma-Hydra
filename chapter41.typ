He asked to meet her alone in Zastrian's Cloister. The moment she stepped in,
she saw four Excubitores clad in chainmail, their spears facing her direction. 
Ralens the Younger sat on the same chair he had used as a prince. The smell of cooking meat clung in the air. 

A noteworthy element was the effigy of the Goddess on the altar. Claradore would have never allowed such a blatant insult. 

Livia glared at the four Excubitores before heading towards her brother's position. He raised himself as she approached him, clapping his hands.

She sensed the first Excubitore thrust behind her. Livia rolled her eyes.
_Betrayed by my own brother...What a pain,_ she thought. She grabbed her hidden dagger. In his hulking armor, he could not match her velocity nor her nimbleness.
She found his throat, stabbing it twice. Blood gushed from the wound. The Excubitore fell.

The second, third and fourth men thought themselves to be wiser, encircling her instead. They did not understand that steel was impractical against a Magi.
Her arms melted, forming whips. Her brother wanted a dance, and she would gladly oblige. Livia swung, feeling her arms slice through flesh as if she was a hot knife through butter. She revolved again and again. Droplets of blood splattered on her face and her crimson gown. One by one, the Excubitores fell. 
One of them clung to his intestines that seeped from his open wound. She cut off his head.

Turning her head towards her traitorous brother, she wiped her hands on an Excubitores' cape.

"Care to explain this, brother," asked Livia.

"H-H-How long have you used my sister like this?" hissed Ralens the Younger.

"I have always been your sister, brother," said Livia.

"Y-You lie.  I-I can hear the voice from that medallion...Who are you?"

Again with the pointless questions. She was Livia for all things concerned. 
Honing his magical aptitudes had been an error it seems.

"I was born another name," said Livia. His face hungered for answers. She would provide a performance. Livia took a deep breath, She felt her blood cascade from her eyes, nose, throat. It agglomerated beneath her neck, forming a visage she had not seen in months. Her skin tingled. Livia made the protruding face smile.

"N-N-Nix?" Ralens the Younger's voice cracked like thin ice. The question made the bulge recede.

"My name is now Livia," said Livia coldly.

"But why? I thought... we were friends."

Livia's tongue clicked. "You naive, naive boy, still clinging to fairy tales. In the theater of court, there are only pieces on the board. Only interests that align... until they don't." said Livia with Nix's voice.

"All of it was lies?"

"You grasp nothing, do you, brother?" Her voice hardened. "The throne is mine by blood and conquest both. Tell me, brother: what have you done to earn your gilded seat? What battles have you fought? What scars do you bear?" She gestured to herself. "I have been broken, scorched by the Faith's wrath and remade in fire. While you Purpleborn waste your inheritance on feasts and follies, half an empire bleeds, waiting for someone worthy to make it whole again."

"You speak madness, Nix. None of this...""

"Do not call me by that lowly name!"" The voice shifted again, becoming Livia's own "Am I not your dearest sister?" said Livia.

"You traitor! You are the reason Sextus troubles us! You are holding the city hostage! Thousands of lives hang in the balance because of your selfishness, Nix!"
screamed Ralens, his face as crimson as the Medean phoenix.

"The murderer calls the butcher red-handed. I only did this for the Empire's sake.It is my birthright. I have been tasked by the Goddess herself to carve this world into something mightier. I am Her chosen weapon. Why do you oppose me when all that I have done has improved our livelihood and our prestige."

He molded his right arm into a blood blade. Livia's smile turned into a wide grin.
Truly madness has consumed him. What did he expect to challenge a Magi such as her?

"Return her." Ralens' voice shook, but he held the blade steady. "Give me back my sister's body. Now. Do this, and...And there will be mercy. No trial. No dungeon. I swear it on my father's name. You'll have safe passage, exile with honor. A ship. Gold. Your life."

"The time for that is long behind us," She showed her hands. " These hands are silk gloves that never come off. This perfume I wear... It is soaked into my very bones" She raised her voice. " "Never. Do you hear me? Never will I crawl back into that skin. Never again will I be that wretched Elysian slave again, bleeding in the dark!"

He lunged at her. _Look at him. The boy playing at war,_ thought Livia.  So the student aspired to surpass the master. Livia would not allow it. She parried the strike with her own blood blade. 
Their faces were inches away from one another. She smelled his perspiration and his dry breath. Such hatred and desperation in his once innocent eyes. 
Livia did not know whether she should be proud or not. Her student had finally known true misery. He was ready to take his father's mantle.

Ralens grunted.

She felt his arm liquefy itself. Livia followed through. His arsenal of tricks was rather limited. To her surprise, his head, neck and torso followed. 
His liquefied form fell on the floor, emulating a sea. There were waves that rolled with increasing intensity.

His intentions were obvious. Livia melted her entire body. 
Her mind wandered in her library of creation, parsing through spells and cants.
It was a place where the notion of time did not apply. 
From her arsenal of books, she deduced he would form a tidal wave intent on sweeping her away.

_You think yourself clever,_ thought Livia.

Livia quickened her breath. Every breath became a wave. Her lungs were the conductor of her sea's orchestra. Her blood twirled, its radial velocity increasing at every turn. She transformed into a cyclone to meet his tsunami.
Soon it became time for both flows to test the strength of their resolve.

The two waterways collided intending to swallow and devour each other. Every one of her molecules of blood duelled each of his. 
Yet she sensed doubt and fear in his blood. When one fought as water, there could be no such thing as uncertainty or unknowns. Once you were drowned in the adversary's essence, only oblivion awaited you. Your consciousness would fade, never to enter the Gates of the Underworld.

One by one, her molecules prevailed. Livia had won her vessel in the fairest of all manners. Why did some still deny her her prize? Jealousy was the answer. She now possessed the most ravishing form in the Medean Empire. She poured her heart and soul in maintaining this image. Every mistake her old self and Domitian had done had been corrected. Sextus would be an afterthought in a matter of hours. What were there to criticize? Only an utter imbecile would surrender those privileges.

Moreover, she had only instructed her opponent for less than a month. The Cants of Yulwoth, the Spells of the Clarans, all of these secrets laid hidden for someone of Ralens' level. If only he had waited. She laughed. There was no pleasure in defeating an amateur.

By the time she sensed her victory was near, Livia disengaged. Ralens' sea was expelled from the battlefield.
Both of them reverted to their solid form. Her blood blade flirted with his throat. His jaw was bloodied. He panted heavily.

"You stole her from me," he pleaded, his voice wavering. Then take me as well. I'm begging you...Just...Just take me too."

"I am no kinslayer, brother."

"Don't," he said curtly. She frowned. "Do not call me, brother."

"I am Empress now." She lifted her chin, regal and unmoved. "I speak as I wish, do as I please." She surged forward, holding his throat in her hand.  Her nails could have dung into his skin at that very instant. "The crown answers to no one...not even you."

"You're not her," he rasped. His eyes were red-rimmed. "You're nothing but a thief! A lowlife thief wearing her skin! A shadow in stolen flesh!"

"I am not a man of the Faith. I give you mercy to rethink your decision...Brother. You will meditate and come to the conclusion that I have been a better Livia than my old self. Together, we can make this nation taller than it ever was."
