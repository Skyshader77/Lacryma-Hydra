"H-H-How long have you used my sister like this?" hissed Ralens the Younger.

"I have always been your sister, brother," said Livia.

"Y-You lie.  I-I can hear the voice from that medallion...Who are you?"

Again with the pointless questions. She was Livia for all things concerned. 
Honing his magical aptitudes had been an error it seems.

"You are the reason Sextus troubles us! You are holding the city hostage!"
screamed Ralens.

"I only did this for the Empire's sake."

He molded his right arm into a blood blade.

"You will return my sister's body."

"The time for that is already behind us."

He lunged at her. So the student aspired to surpass the master. 
Livia would not allow it. She parried the strike with her own blood blade. 
Their faces were inches away from one another. She smelled his perspiration and his dry breath. He grunted.

She felt his arm liquefy itself. Livia followed through. He became a tidal wave. She transformed into a cyclone. The two flows collided intending to swallow devour each other. Every one of her droplets of blood duelled each of his. 
Yet she sensed doubt and fear in his blood. When one fought as water, there could be no such thing as uncertainty or unknowns.

Livia had won her vessel in the fairest of all manners. Why did some still deny her her prize? Jealousy was the answer. She now possessed the most ravishing form in the Medean Empire. She poured her heart and soul in maintaining this image. Every mistake her old self and Domitian had done had been corrected. Sextus would be an afterthought in a matter of hours. What were there to criticize? Only an utter imbecile would surrender those privileges.

Moreover, she had only instructed her opponent for less than a month. The Cants of Yulwoth, the Spells of the Clarans, all of these secrets laid hidden for someone of Ralens' level. If only he had waited. She laughed. There was no pleasure in defeating an amateur.

By the time, both of them reverted to their solid form. Her blood blade flirted with his throat. His jaw was bloodied.

"You took my sister away from me. Take me too," he pleaded.

"I am no kinslayer, brother."

"Do not call me brother."

"I am the Empress. I do as I please."

"You are only wearing her skin."

"I am not a man of the Fait. I give you mercy to rethink your decision...Brother. You will meditate and come to the conclusion that I have been a better Livia than my old self. Together, we can make this nation taller than it ever was."
