Desperate times call for inhabiting a black rat’s body. The prey of her favorite hosts. Nix was trammeled by the fact that Serena could identify her while wearing a cat’s mask. In ordinary situations, she would have never considered becoming a parasite, this creature that fed on filth. Carriers of disease, rats were more than capable of bringing entire armies to their knees. The Medean Empire had sent both men and cats to eradicate this vermin during the Plague of Anastasian. No matter how many rat skulls were heaped in the streets of Thanatopolis, the rodents outnumbered men by at least a four to one ratio. The ability to absorb these casualties had captivated Nix when she still had access to Baba’s encyclopedias. After four years of urban warfare, the Medean Emperor Anastasian capitulated to his whiskery foes. Medean legions retreated from the capital’s streets, leaving them to the usual animosity between cats and rats. Through its valor and resilience, a small animal had shown itself capable of surviving the might of humanity’s steel. If it could defeat mankind, could it also prevail against a slayer of gods?

Nix climbed the sewage pipe. Her objective laid beyond the faint light at the end of the tunnel. Scents she would usually abhor such as feces, urine and sulfurous food now pleased her. Never had she thought she would delight in swimming in literal shit. Serena would have laughed at the absurdity of the situation. If only she could talk to Serena.

"Look at you, Phoenix Wing! How adorable you must be right now!" echoed Serena’s words.

Had Serena been here, she would have picked Nix up and almost crushed the rat’s form with her tender hugs. She might have held Nix by her whiskers while lobbing volley after volley of questions. Were rats as intelligent as humans as Zhapur claimed? Was it easier to evade predators?

You must be careful if you intend to wear another’s mask for an indeterminate period of time," had said Claradore.

The Magi had spoken of men who wore wolves’ skin. They had eaten, defecated and even fornicated as wolves. Life as an animal offered simplicity and evasion from daggers pointed at your back. One hour, one day, one week turned into a month, a year. In these acts, the beast’s consciousness dominated the human’s. No longer could they exit the form they had come to love. No longer could they understand the speech of humans. No longer could they feel disgust when consuming human flesh. No longer could they scream for help when hunters slaughtered their pack.

Yet it was a risk she was willing to take. When one took a high risk, one could only meet two distinct fates: debilitating failure or a crushing success.

Nix emerged from the sink of Livia’s bathroom. Ceramic tiles meshed with dove patterns greeted her small eyes. The door laid open, the princess’ body lying on her bed. Nix took a deep breath before using the rat’s body to make a mad dash for the underside of the bed. No human sounds could be heard. The room smelled of incense and Livia’s vanilla perfume.

Alone. She was alone with the princess who was clothed in Nix’ favorite dress. Purple silk with golden phoenix motifs enhanced with the amethyst necklace procured by Domitian. Her porcelain skin mocked the scars on Nix’s body. The crown sitting on her study gazed at Nix’ empty head. Both Livia and Nix had come to bear witness to the Goddess’ wrath yet only one had seen their body mutilated. Another reason why Alexander had to disappear.

Not knowing if this was the last time she would do this, the rat’s body shook as she left its husk. Her body reformed itself. And so did her injuries that the rat’s body had hidden. Her blisters and burn marks assaulted her anew. Multiple blisters exploded. Blood and pus ran from her arms, legs, shoulders. Nix convulsed in agony. It was as if thousands of sharp blades had impaled her at once. She cursed at the person in the mirror.

"You were too impatient," rung Claradore’s voice in her head.

#emph[Patience will lead to our demise.]

"What in the Goddess’ name was that?" yelled a handmaiden’s voice from the outside.

"Go fetch the key and the Excubitores!" yelled another.

Running footsteps roared in the distance. Nix swore. She could not move. Her breath stank of death. She bit her lip. Concentrate. Her heart raced through its rib cage.

"My gold coin," said Baba’s voice.

#emph[What?]

Her eyes flashed. Nix saw herself standing before the Gates of the Underworld.

She somehow knew that there was going to to be two pillars. The Gatekeeper, its eyeless and mouthless oval face watching her with interest, spread its black wings as ravishing as a monarch butterfly’s. It was taller than the Palace Complex itself, with a human body that somehow stole the beauty of both male and female physique.

The loud creaking of the gates, every inch of the revealed other side unearthed something deep within her. Her bones trembled. All those who could the read the Forgotten Tongue had seen them once and had come back. Like her, their heads spun while standing before the Gates. A vertigo for gazing at their colossal height. She breathed this sort of miasma, a mixture of unatural ashes and damp soil which clouded anything else in this dimension, knowing exactly how the air would tickle her nose, how its composition would scratch her lungs.

Few could boast seeing the Gates more than twice. Nix knew how the cyclopedian arches towered above her small form, how the Hellhounds looked down at her with their teeth as large as a man’s arm, how the planets aligned in the astral void. Standing here and being able to tell the tale. How unreal it must had felt during the Age of Magic when more could see it and return to their plane. Unburdened by senses and the limitations of a physical boundary, the sorcerers of old had it all.

And the smell. Something she could not associate with any object nor animal, a unknown flagrance she had to be familiar with. One which had once inundated her sense, one which could make her forget her worst fears and mend her greatest wounds. When was the first time she has been here? When did the barks of the Hellhounds to the shape of the eroded rocks were engraved in her psyche? Even Claradore did not know.

This time, the gargoyles perched atop took the form of Claradore. All reached out with their open arms at her, providing a tantalizing offer, one she accepted once in her distant remembrance. #emph[Show it to me...The price for attaining magic.] Without hesitation, she accepted like all those born during the Age of Magic.

It started. That song. The song which she had memorized the lyrics for as long as she has lived. That song which she had taught the Goddess herself. This time it was a voice who always sang it from the confines of her memory, a voice which was entwined with that smell. It was soft, gentle yet imbibed in tears and regret, a siren heralding Nix’ inevitable fate. #emph[So it is true.] The legends never told in the past spoke of the Gates who mutated before every human who passed between them. Old men would meet their long lost lovers or pets. Younger ones would reunite with the children who had departed too soon. Orphans would leap into the arms of their parents. #emph[You find anything and anyone you have lost at the Gates.] These theories had once amused her, tales the older generations told for millenia only for her to be greeted by an empty reception.

The gates continued their opening, an increasingly blinding light escaped from the other side. The song undulated between high and low pitches in an inhuman frenzy even she could not match. Just who or what was taunting her from the other side? She felt water flowing beneath her feet. Neither cold nor hot. A current of feathers, no of delicate silk caressed her legs. Thousands of blue lights radiated in the stream, zipping in a single file to their final destination. Nix tried to grab one, only to find a luminous ball with a tail in her palm. She never imagined it to be warm. The light wiggled frantically in her hand, aiming for the Gates. Within it, she glimpsed at someone’s childhood, their first love, the death of their father, their marriage to the birth of their first daughter, to the sight of a bloodied womb, a monotonous life untouched by desire and constrained by mundane goals. All of that existence contained in a glowing orb. #emph[The absurdity of it all.]

Nix could have stared at the river all day long while holding the ball. Time and space being frozen in this realm. She felt she could fly. Higher and higher. Phoenix, gryons, hydras, dragons, Nix would soar further than any of them could. She laughed at the thought, herself levitating in the boundary of living and dead. Nix could not breathe, yet she lived at her fullest at this moment. It had never occurred to her how not being able to touch nor smell could soothe the human mind. This lost sensation. Humanity had been fools in forgetting it.

She released the orb, causing it to fly towards the gate alongside its compatriots. #emph[Go. Be free. Free from the misery you have endured.] Beyond the gargantuan doors, the castle she saw every night in her dream laid beyond, reality mixing with imagination. Walls made from tears dropped from rainless countries. Laughter, chatter were heard from its never-ending lights. Inside, she dreamt of the grandiose ballrooms and banquet halls where she could house the stray dogs she rescued from shelters. There, she would water her mouth with durians, mangos, pandan leaves, fruits evoking a distant pleasure in her tongue, one which would see her travel back to hazy hanging gardens found somewhere in the Known World. From within the palace, a figure was taking shape. It became more and more human like as it walked towards Nix, shadows of limbs and arms coalescing before her very eyes. The song. It was the figure’s doing. Had Nix brought her dagger, she would have clutched it.

What emerged from the gates was an elderly woman with a blue and green eye. Nix teared up.

"To be able to see you again...You have grown taller than I ever did. Fate has offered us this moment as a curse and as a blessing," said Baba.

"Baba! Baba! BABA!" screamed Nix as she ran towards the one she could never call mother.

"I am sorry to have parted ways with you, my gold coin. It was never my intention to leave you with Claradore and that vile woman. They have made you walk on a nightmarish path."

They had so much to converse about, so many stories she wanted to share. But first there was the touch. A touch that rivaled even the most passionate of kisses, awakening an emotion Nix has not felt in summers. A touch whose kindness would paralyze her from neck to toe.

"Come with me, to the other side, my gold coin. We shall be safe there," said Baba. Baba seemed so far yet so close to her.

"Wait for me, Baba! I’m coming! I’m coming!" said Nix as she ran under the eyeless face of the Gatekeeper.

She wanted that hug. A hug that felt as if thousands of blades struck her heart, bringing elation and despair simultaneously. An earthquake of cries that would shake her very being, the glass castle that was the reality she had built collapsing, its shards hitting her vital organs.

It was not meant to be. The sky tore itself asunder. At that very moment the thing called Alexander glowed from the firmament, descending into the Gates of the Underworld. The Hellhounds barked. The river of souls left its bed, the orbs vibrating frantically. Her enemy whisked his finger in a haughty manner. Pillars of light collapsed into the structure. Nix ate dust, rolling on the ground. Hellhounds disintegrated. The Gatekeeper remained unfazed. Baba reentered the Gates of the Underworld. The doors closed.

In Livia’s room, Nix cursed, allowing her sheer rage to guide her. Her blood flowed upwards, carrying her on the bed frame. A river she had become, undulating between its bed. Yet her stream yearned for a natural flow. It sought its mouth or a sea or an ocean into which it could pour itself. And so she coursed over the surface of human flesh like she had done so on that unique night with Claradore’s Artifice.

Had she lived in the Age of Magic, she would have been crucified. Even attempts at this were tantamount to premeditated murder. Yet, even the thing called Serena could not anticipate this action, an action that flouted the rules the Magi had established.

Her river found its mouth or rather Livia’s mouth. Nix let herself be swallowed by the princess’ tongue. Curtains of red descended on her vision. In an instant, she felt toes dangling beneath bedsheets, fingers touching a duvet, her right cheek resting on a pillow. For the first time in her life, Nix prayed to the Goddess.
