An effervescence of rumors shook the court on this auspicious day. The mechanical birds sangs songs of rebirth. Yes, the phoenix was reborn. Livia has returned. This time, she sat on the Throne of Phoenix Feathers next to the Regent Domitian. 
Her brother spectated the court's events behind her. With Domitian at the regency, it would take only paperwork and time before Domitian acquired the crown. Divine providence had struck the charlatan that was Claradore a few nights before. Livia had cried with delight in her litter when her brother's messengers reached her carriage. She and Domitian hurried back to Thanatopolis.

Upon reaching her room, the Magister Sursurri had informed her that the whereabouts of both Claradore and Boniface were unknown. What luck! The keys to the throne handed over to her on a silver plate. Livia would ensure that ample offerings would reach the Goddess' altars throughout the empire.

The chatters of courtiers debating the existence of monsters brought her back to the ballroom that was court. Sketches and crude paintings of flying beats circulated throughout the city. Eunuchs and Excubitores presented her some of these amateurish works of art. It seemed the disappearance of Claradore and Boniface had plunged the populace into a collective delirium. Monsters roaming the premises of the imperial capital? A mere fantasy concocted by the Medean Empire's enemies. Her first order was to have the Excubitores and the Scholae Palatinae arrest any soothsayer or false oracles that propagated these falsehoods.
The last thing the crown needed was a mass delusion that could lead to riots.

Her second order was to ascertain the almost probable death of both Boniface and Claradore. Daggers must have flown in the shadows in her absence, leaving both the Faith and the Red Guild wandering the streets akin to headless chicken. At last, she would reclaim the mantle of sovereign from the spider's web. 

In all evidence, a celebration was in order. Her marriage was now expedited. In less than a month, she would wed Domitian in Zastrian's Cloister. Swarms of handmaidens and eunuchs scurried from the palace grounds, carrying porphyry furniture to the cathedral. Dressmakers lined up before the Palace Complex, offering their services. She already had a grand vision for her dress, a white swan robe padded with silk purple ribbons. Elaborate phoenix and dove patterns would adorn the attire. The Known World needed to know that her victory was one fo the Purpleborn and the Faith.

"The Cardinal Alexander would like an audience with you on the morrow," said Domitian. The purple cloak of the Emperor was draped over his broad shoulders. It was fastened with a dragon pin that complemented well his toga.

Livia's mind explored the possibility of Alexander eliminating a rival Cardinal and disposing of the heathen Claradore as well. The man was discreet and quiet. He could be dangerous but with Boniface missing, it was in the Faith's best interests to show avarice for attention.

"We will hear what he has to say. What do the physicans say about the body the Excubitores found?" said Livia.

"The winged woman? They are still dissecting her now as we speak."

"A winged woman?" inquired her brother. He still wore the crown of phoenix feathers atop his small head.

"We found a corpse afflicted by a bizarre illness, brother. The Excubitores claim white wings sprouted from her back."

"None of the findings must reach the common folk," said Domitian. 

"Agreed. All notices speak about our wedding."

"What about the monsters?" said Ralens the Younger.

"There are no monsters to speak about. You have let your boyish imagination command your decision-making."

"But I did see them the other fortnight. Winged beasts that were neither birds nor bats. I tried to summon Claradore but the Crimson Spider had vacated his office."

"Never to return along with Cardinal Boniface. Quite the tragedy," lied Livia.

"We cannot be certain of that, sister."

"He is correct," said a familiar voice. A shudder ran through her bones. That voice. It was hers. An Elysian girl stood in front of Livia, a wide grin was drawn on her visage. Somehow, the girl was dressed in the crimson and obsidian robe Livia adored. 

"You! You insolent girl! You wear my clothes!"

"Poor, poor princess who revels in perfection. I will be wearing more than your clothes soon."

"Get this unsightly thing out of my vision! To the gallows!"

"Livia? What are you saying?" asked Ralens the Younger, his face full of consternation.

"The Elysian brat! Have your men seize her, Domitian!"

"Livia, there are no Elysians in the throne room right now," said Domitian.

"Are you two blind? She stands there wearing my dress!"

To her horror, both Domitian and Ralens the Younger shot each other looks of incomprehension. The Excubitores and Scholae and Palatinae all turned in her direction.

"They will not be able to help you, princess," said the Elysian as she toyed with her braided hair, the locks were fashioned in the same manner as Livia's. Truly the Goddess was taunting her at this moment. Was she hallucinating?

Livia shut her eyes. Her mother had once imagined the Goddess speaking to her directly in this room. The tragedy of it all was that her delirious ramblings were witnessed by the entire court, serving a dish of embarrassment to her late father. It was this incident that caused her mother to be banished from Thanatopolis.

Her head spun as if she was caught in a whirlpool. Men and women around her were duplicating themselves. Her breathing became more and more arduous. An infernal ringing reverberated through her head.

"It seems the princess is tired. She should return to her chambers," said Domitian. Livia nodded. All the affairs she had to solve must have exhausted her. Even the labors of victory could drain the greatest of generals.
