She found Ralens throwing rocks atop the walls of Thanatopolis. Winds howled. 
He wore an all purple and crimson chiton patterned with flying phoenixes and 
roaring dragons, the crown of phoenix feathers on his head.
Majorian and seven other Excubitores stood guard. It was the first time she saw him dressed like a man, encased 
in chainmail with an ornate helmet. 
A red moon shone over the North Sea. Dromons and quinqueremes sailed through the night
towards the capital's lighthouse. Their numbers had more than doubled since last year.

Behind them, clamors rose from the Hippodrome. The Emeralds and the Sapphires were 
practicing for the next chariot races. Once Nix was done walking Spartak, she would join the audience. Like Baba before her, she had fallen to the trap of wagering her salary on 
her favorite team. Mathematically, placing a bet on a team defied all laws of probability. However, no feeling surpassing quadrupling one's bet once the horses crossed the finish line.

"I made Livia co-Empress," said Ralens as he threw a rock towards the starless night.

Nix grimaced. It was obvious the princess would not let the phoenix sit alone in the spider's web. 

"You do not trust Claradore after all those years?" said Nix, feigning ignorance.

"No, it was Claradore's idea. I have seen how she and Domitian looked at the crown. Enemies should be kept close."

"So they can press their daggers against your throat? Heed my advice: send Domitian to the East. The man craves blood."

He shook his head. His right hand picked up another pebble. He launched it towards the North Sea. It ricocheted twenty times in the water. Nix did the same. With magic, she could make it bounce forty-eight times. And similar to anything related to magic, Claradore would find a way to showcase his innate talent. The man could form a slingshot out of his arms. When rocks were thrown by him, Nix believed they could reach the Rauthengardian shores.

"Domitian will get his chance. War will come," said Ralens, his voice trembling.

"When it does, will you truly want Livia next to you? Enemies on the inside are always 
the most dangerous."

"Not if you are willing to be my ears."

_An interesting proposition,_ thought Nix. In the art of negotiation, the first person 
to give a price was defeated. Here, she was his senior by seven years. Surely, 
she could swipe a great deal out of his proposition.

"Standing in Livia's presence is a cumbersome task," said Nix. 

Ralens made a mischievous smile.
"Are you sure? I know you fancy borrowing her clothes."

Nix blushed. She glared at Majorian. The Scholae Palatinae turned his eyes away.

"I-I-I swore an oath to the Emperor!" said Majorian.

"Rest assured, I do not mind your eccentricities. In fact, your proximity to Livia will be of great use. All of Livia's thoughts and actions must be reported to me," said Ralens.

"I trust I will be well compensated for this," said Nix.

"Of course, I will create a title for you, the Magister Sacra Vestis."

A title for herself only. Baba would be proud of her and so would Serena.

"May Serena join in?"

"The Magister Sacra Vestis may enlist others as they see fit."

They walked down the stairs from the Marroan Walls. As Magister Sacra Vestis, Nix 
would be the conductor of Livia's wardrobe. It was she who would weight on which shade of purple the princess would wear as her daily attire. It also legitimized her hobby of borrowing Livia's sumptuous clothes. She could not wait. The next public appearance for the princess was to be during the arrival of the new Cardinal. There, Medean 
tradition had her wear a swan white dress similar to the Faith's colors.

"Your August Majesty!" cried a distressed woman at the end of the stairs. 
A small gathering of townfolk had congregated around the Excubitores. 

"Please, the Emperor is tired. He must return to the palace," said Majorian.

"No, let him listen. This seems worth his time. Speak, citizen" said Nix. Ralens nodded in agreement.
It was a fantastic opportunity to paint him as a man of the people.

"A monster lives in our well. It took my boy!" said the woman.

"It took my sister and her husband!" said another man.

"The Vigiles were of no help! Help us, your August Majesty!"

_Again with this story. What are they eating?_ thought Nix.

"There are no monsters in Thanatopolis," said Nix.

"Yes! I saw it! With my own two eyes! It dwells in the sewers! Please, your August Majesty, you must help us!"

The crowd prostrated itself before Ralens. The fact that so many believed in the same
superstition unnerved Nix. A monster living in the sewers? Was this another of the Faith's lies?

"Show me the well," said Ralens.

Nix pulled him asides.

"Are you sure, this is better left to the Excubitores," whispered Nix.

"The same we hanged a month ago? Were they not screaming about a monster as well?"

"Remember Claradore's teachings. The Faith invents monsters out of their arses."

"I will see the well."

Nix bowed. Ralens entered his litter. Their procession snaked around Charov's Aqueduct, passing through 
self-proclaimed oracles who pretended to see the end of times. Nix and Majorian 
waved away the hordes of merchants wanting to present their wares to the Emperor.

_The Emperor graces you with his presence! Please grant him away,_ thought Nix as she yelled those same words to navigate through the sea of humans that was the imperial capital.

"The Empress will be sleeping in Domitian's villa tonight," said Majorian with a 
wide grin on his face.

"We can continue playing our little game," said Nix.

For the past weeks, they had practiced dancing as if they were the guests of honors in a ball. She practiced doing pirouettes in his wide arms. Clothed or not, they felt their bodies coalesce in warmth. At the junction of their movements, they discovered 
how similar and dissimilar their heartbeats were, how one's tempo while dancing conveyed their state of mind. She embraced serenity in her gestures while his professed this orderly chaos typical of men who served in the army.

Ralens' litter arrived at the well, this hole surrounded by effigies of the Goddess. 
Nix restrained herself from laughing. Surely the citizens were making a farce. A monster living in a well? If it was magical, she and Claradore would have known of its existence by now. 

Spartak growled at the well. It stood on its four legs, glaring at the structure.

"What is wrong?" asked Nix.

The Emperor disembarked from his carriage. He advanced towards the well. Spartak's barks grew louder and louder. 

"Hold, the water may be poisoned," said Nix. It was the only logical explanation for 
her dog's behavior.

"I will not be drinking," said Ralens. He peered into the opening. 
"There is nothing here."

"Send an alchemist here. The water must be foul. Perhaps a Faithful put their waste in it," said Nix.

Ralens grimaced and turned away from the well. Spartak barked ferociously. She saw too late the tentacle emerge from the well. It grabbed the Emperor. Ralens yelled. Majorian let out profanities. The tentacle dragged its captive towards the hole. The Scholae Palatinae dropped his shield and lance. His hands seized the monster's appendage. In an instant, his body barreled down the darkness.
