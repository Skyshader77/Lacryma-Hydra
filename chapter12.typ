The princess Livia had departed for her summer residence alongside Domitian. 
Nix relished such opportunities for she was able to sneak into the purple born's 
room. 

The golden gilded door creaked open. Livia's perfume, made of jasmine and roses
caught her nose. An arsenal of dresses, stolas and coats fluttered in the gargantuan
wardrobe. Flickering candles shone on the opulent shades of purple, rose, crimson and gold. 

Nix walked on the mosaic floor which depicted the Goddess' final departure from the 
land of the living. Her hands made their way into Livia's army of robes. 
Her guilty pleasure had been to wear clothes that she could never purchase.
Her fingers touched the softest silk, the brightest rose, the warmest feathers.
Nix could feel her own face turn green. It was never fair.

She found the object of her desires: this long flowing gown with a mantle of gold 
binding the neckline. A crimson cape embroidered with the Medean phoenix extended 
from the back of the outfit. Livia had only worn the attire once during her 
engagement to Domitian. Why even bother commissioning the dress if you only wore it 
a single time?

_The purple born and their eccentricities_ thought Nix.

She removed her handmaiden clothes and put on the gown, delighting in its 
tender fabric.

Before her stood a girl who dreamed to become a princess. For this one night, Nix 
would grant that girl's wishes. 

Sitting in front of Livia's mirror, Nix combed her hair in the exact same manner 
as Livia. The princess' armada of perfume bottles tempted her. Yet the flagrance 
that interested her was the ornate bottle shaped like a dragon. Only one woman in 
the Known World could possess that scent, one that commanded authority. Foreign dignitaries would be in awe of smelling such a perfume that seemed to transcend 
human senses. Nix would put two droplets on her neck.

And at last came the princess' crown, this diadem encrusted with the now exiled empress Thessaly's jewels. Nix knew the rubies adorning the crown would suit her 
head. Her hands deposited the ornament on herself.

_Why can't it all be mine?_ thought Nix.

She rotated around the room, contemplating how the attire magnified her 
elegance. Nix smiled. Perhaps, she could borrow the gown indefinitely. The purple born did not understand the privilege the Goddess 
bestowed them upon birth.

A cough came behind her. Nix yelped.

"Wh-Wh-Who is there?" said Nix.

A long haired person of her age stood there, flashing a familiar smile. 
Like her, they had been cursed with uniqueness for she knew the Goddess 
has given them both male and female genitalia. In fact, one often had to wonder 
if this Majorian fellow was a man or a woman. Majorian could pass as both 
without much effort. To Nix, having being bestowed both male and female 
components made them the pinnacle of human beauty.

For tonight, Majorian chose to be a man wearing a Scholae Palatinae's dress, a black chiton lined with ruby patterns with the golden neck-torques. 

"I hope I am not disturbing anything," said Majorian in the Classical Tongue 
with a male voice. If Majorian would ever enter the annals of history, 
it would be through his melodious voice that could conquer any soul with 
both its range and its power. Through Claradore's patronage, Majorian became the 
capital's foremost singer, their performance attracting dignitaries, courtiers, merchants, nobles and children alike in the Palace Complex's amphitheater.

Nix jumped into their arms, letting her lips meet their.

"How was your play?" said Nix.

"The children fancied it. Though I tire of playing the Firstborn. Melina has slain me forty-eight times this year as the Goddess." They inspected the sleeves and fabric of Nix's dress. "Quite the original attire you are wearing."

"Tell me it suits me more than the princess."

"You always shine brighter than the princess."

Nix blushed, planting another kiss on his lips.
To Majorian, Nix must have appeared like an Elysian 
princess. They said that the Emperor of Kings Nosrau's line descended from the Firstborn's celestial domain. They were angels that brought salvation to the 
Elysian populace, liberating them from the Goddess' tyranny. Any mortal would be in awe before these angelic beings.

"I have heard you and Serena have had no success with the medallion," said Majorian.

"Zhapur informed me it relates to a certain Elysian empress. Aishula, they called her. There's nothing in the archives. No records. As if she never existed." said Nix.

"I am to perform at Kornikus' Villa in a few months. The Elysian patricians will gather thereâ€”the Emperor of Kings celebrates his ascension."

"And you expect me to magically find a locksmith among them?"

"No. The patricians are old families. Someone will remember an empress the archives forgot."

"The Goddess knows why my medallion is related to her."

"Perhaps you're her long-lost daughter. Wouldn't that be a tale for a singer such as me?"

Nix glared at them. "This is not a fairy tale."

Domitian clasped her hands with theirs, gripping her with both a woman's delicateness and a man's strength.
"But you would like it to be. Would you prefer me a prince on a white horse?"

"I do not deny it."

Majorian's voice shifted higher, taking on a woman's cadence. "And what if I was a princess instead of a prince? What then?"

"Why do you entertain that thought? You can be anyone you desire."

"I am curious."

"Any throne would buckle under two princesses kissing on it."

"But it is the Emperor who defines the decrees, the rules, the law. We could stop the killing of people of my kind."

"Claradore will remake this world in his image. He has already saved you and gave you a purpose."

"He is but a collector of broken bizarre things. We are all incongruities that he rescued. Let us be realistic. He will ask sacrifices out of us in return."

"That is why we only belong in the Red Guild. 
Not even our own parents wanted us."

Majorian gave a smile full of melancholy. He sniffed Nix's or rather Livia's 
sweat and perfume that still clung to the dress. "May I call you my Lady while you are wearing Livia's clothes?"

My Lady. Two words that sent tremors of pleasure down Nix's spine. Yes, that was 
what she aspired to be named. If only everyone could refer to her by those two words. Nix was destined for royalty. All bones and flesh within her very being clamored for the divine right to rule.

Nix cleared her throat. "You are clever one. Words don't sway me so easily." said Nix with a flawless imitation of Livia's voice.

"Livia, I am but a simple soldier. Do not use such vocabulary with me,"
answered Majorian as Domitian.

"Your colossal stupidity is why I chose you."

Majorian puffed their cheeks, posturing their shoulders to accentuate 
their muscles in the same manner as Domitian.
"Livia please! I am a Magister Militum, the highest ranking military man in the 
Empire! You must respect me!"

"You did not attain it by merit but by woos. My father chose you over Ordogan after I begged him day and night."

Both Nix and Majorian burst into incontrollable laughter. The absence of Livia 
and her fiancee was a golden opportunity to practice their skills in the theater.
Pretending to be purple born was a hobby as addictive as magic mushroom. 
Everything was simpler when one could throw denarii at any problem. 

"The Known World will never understand us. It is sad," said Majorian.

Majorian's eyes peered at the crown Nix was wearing.

"My Lady fancies a throne?"

Nix blushed. What would they want as an answer? The answer was obvious to her. 

"An Elysian on the Medean throne? You still speak about fairy tales," said Nix.

"Fairy tales can come to pass. You have heard the prophecy."

_An Elysian will rule the Known World_ thought Nix, a fantasy all Elysian monarchs 
believed in for the past three centuries. It poisoned their bloodline, causing 
them to wage war against the Medean Empire. All imagined themselves to the one 
who would seize Thanatopolis.

"They are fairy tales because reality is a cruel mistress," said Nix.

"A mistress everyone weds."

"Clever poetry. Would it please you to recite some for me?"

Before he could soothe with songs, the sound of boots clattering in the corridor alerted her. Nix scoured the room. Majorian gasped as her hands dragged him under Livia's bed. His breath was pressed against her left hand.

Two sets of boots entered the tiled floor. Nix deduced they were Excurbitores by the weight of their footsteps. 

"I swore someone yelped here," said one Excurbitore with a thick Clovian accent.

"Must have been rats," said a second Excurbitore with a Rauthengardian accent.

"Inform the emperor that rat catchers will be needed."

"We may need more than rat catchers. Two of our own have not returned in days."

"Deserters. They left their gold in their quarters. We may seize it."

The Excurbitores circled the room. "No, they were exploring the palace's underground. There is something lurking there, I tell you. We must scour 
the place."

"Your imagination runs wild. The turncloaks have left the city."

"No, no, no, it is a monster. I can hear it slithering within the walls. It speaks to us. It whispers names."

Their boots left the room. Nix and Majorian laid for minutes under the bed, 
hearing their tense breathing. 
They only extirpated themselves out of their hiding place once no sound could be 
heard from the corridor.

"Our lives could have been forfeited," said Majorian.

That was an exaggeration. She could have always used magic to wiggle herself out of this
peril.

"There is beauty in danger," said Nix.

"What?"

"You are a soldier, are you not? Do not lie to me. The thrill of danger arouses you."

"Only the craven seeks violence."

"Do not bore me with morality."

Majorian's nose stood inches away from hers. His clove scented 
breath made her heart palpitate. 
Nix touched his warm hand. Sweat ran from his forehead. They slowly tip toed towards the door, locking him. 

"Do you wish to continue our little play?" Nix said.

"Only if I get to be Livia this time?" said Majorian 
with their female voice.

"Calamitous! There cannot be two of me!" said Nix as Livia. 

"Fool! Don't you see? The Goddess has granted me the ability to 
perfect my self-adulation!"

Nix snickered. Her lips closed the distance. Nix tasted Majorian's sweetness, rivaling the finest wine. 
Their hands grabbed her waist. Nix snuffed the candle on Livia's desk as she sauntered into the bed.
