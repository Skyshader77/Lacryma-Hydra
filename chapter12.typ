She found Ralens throwing rocks atop the walls of Thanatopolis. Winds howled. 
Majorian stood guard. Both Scholae Palatinae and Empire wore plain tunics.
A red moon shone over the North Sea. Dromons and quinqueremes sailed through the night
towards the capital's lighthouse. Their numbers had more than doubled since last year.

Behind them, clamors rose from the Hippodrome. The Emeralds and the Sapphires were 
practicing for the next chariot races. Once Nix was done walking Spartak, she would join the audience. Like Baba before her, she had fallen to the trap of wagering her salary on 
her favorite team. Mathematically, placing a bet on a team defied all laws of probability. However, no feeling surpassing quadrupling one's bet once the horses crossed the finish line.

"I made Livia co-Empress," said Ralens as he threw a rock towards the starless night.

Nix grimaced. It was obvious the princess would not let the phoenix sit alone in the spider's web. 

"You do not trust Claradore after all those years?" said Nix, feigning ignorance.

"No, it was Claradore's idea. I have seen how she and Domitian looked at the crown. Enemies should be kept close."

"So they can press their daggers against your throat? Heed my advice: send Domitian to the East. The man craves blood."

He shook his head. His right hand picked up another pebble. He launched it towards the North Sea. It ricocheted twenty times in the water. Nix did the same. With magic, she could make it bounce forty-eight times. And similar to anything related to magic, Claradore would find a way to showcase his innate talent. The man could form a slingshot out of his arms. When rocks were thrown by him, Nix believed they could reach the Rauthengardian shores.

"Domitian will get his chance. War will come," said Ralens, his voice trembling.

"When it does, will you truly want Livia next to you? Enemies on the inside are always 
the most dangerous."

"Not if you are willing to be my ears."

_An interesting proposition,_ thought Nix. In the art of negotiation, the first person 
to give a price was defeated. Here, she was his senior by seven years. Surely, 
she could swipe a great deal out of his proposition.

"Standing in Livia's presence is a cumbersome task," said Nix. 

Ralens made a mischievous smile.
"Are you sure? I know you fancy borrowing her clothes."

Nix blushed. She glared at Majorian. The Scholae Palatinae turned his eyes away.

"I-I-I swore an oath to the Emperor!" said Majorian.

"Rest assured, I do not mind your eccentricities. In fact, your proximity to Livia will be of great use. All of Livia's thoughts and actions must be reported to me," said Ralens.

"I trust I will be well compensated for this," said Nix.

"Of course, I will create a title for you, the Magister Sacra Vestis."

A title for herself only. Baba would be proud of her and so would Serena.

"May Serena join in?"

"The Magister Sacra Vestis may enlist others as they see fit."

Spartak barked ferociously. She saw too late the tentacle emerge from the well. It grabbed the Emperor. Ralens yelled. Majorian let out profanities. The tentacle dragged its captive towards the hole. The Scholae Palatinae dropped his shield and lance. His hands seized the monster's appendage. In an instant, his body barreled down the darkness.
