The princess Livia had departed for her summer residence alongside Domitian. 
Nix relished such opportunities for she was able to sneak into the Purpleborn's 
room. 

The golden gilded door creaked open. Livia's perfume, made of jasmine and roses
caught her nose. An arsenal of dresses, stolas and coats fluttered in the gargantuan
wardrobe. Flickering candles shone on the opulent shades of purple, rose, crimson and gold. 

An armada of lotions, herbs and powders was lined up like dromons in the dockyards. They stood on furniture whose legs were carved in the shape of dragons alongside with brushes of all sizes in pots awaiting orders.
Medean princesses and empresses commanded the Known World's largest reserve of 
cosmetics, a treasure they did not hesitate to flaunt in the carnival of masks that was court.

Nix walked on the mosaic floor which depicted the Goddess' final departure from the 
land of the living, her swan white wings deployed, carrying the corpse of the Firstborn in her arms. Nix's hands made their way into Livia's army of robes. 
Her guilty pleasure had been to wear clothes that she could never purchase.
Her fingers touched the softest silk, the brightest rose, the warmest feathers.
Nix could feel her own face turn green. It was never fair.

She found the object of her desires: a flowing gown of crimson and black that 
made one look like they were carved out of obsidian and blood. The finest silk 
from the Unknown World constituted the delicate fabric. Livia's scent lingered on the cloth, this crown of honey-sweet rose that blessed its wearer with an exotic 
journey of jasmine, saffron and roses. Only one woman in the Known World could wear this scent: the Medean Empress.

She removed her handmaiden clothes and put on Livia's undergarments. The red and black gown came next. She delighted in its tender fabric, knowing that the cloth 
conveyed both nobility and peril.

Before her stood a girl who dreamed to become a princess. For this one night, Nix 
would grant that girl's wishes. 

Sitting in front of Livia's mirror, Nix combed her hair in the exact same manner 
as Livia. The princess' legions of cosmetics tempted her. Her hands could not resist. She brushed her face. The princess' visage was meant to be beauty honed into weaponry, a destabilizing force that was meant to ease unmasking its beholders.
Nix applied a crimson shadow underneath her eyes. Her lips were painted as red 
as Vyrmogothian wine. 

And at last came the princess' crown, this diadem encrusted with the now exiled empress Thessaly's jewels. Nix knew the rubies adorning the crown would suit her 
head. Her hands deposited the ornament on herself. The crown framed her brown eyes. It was all natural as if she had always been destined to rest atop her head.

_Why can't it all be mine?_ thought Nix.

She rotated around the room, contemplating how the attire magnified her 
elegance. Nix smiled. Perhaps, she could borrow the gown indefinitely. The Purpleborn did not understand the privilege the Goddess 
bestowed them upon birth.

A cough came behind her. Nix yelped.

"Wh-Wh-Who is there?" said Nix.

A long haired person of her age stood there, flashing a familiar smile. 
Like her, they had been cursed with uniqueness for she knew the Goddess 
has given Majorian both male and female genitalia. In fact, one often had to wonder 
if this Majorian fellow was a man or a woman. Majorian could pass as both 
without much effort. To Nix, having being bestowed both male and female 
components made them the pinnacle of human beauty.

For tonight, Majorian chose to be a man wearing a Scholae Palatinae's dress, a black chiton lined with ruby patterns with the golden neck-torques. 

"I hope I am not disturbing anything," said Majorian in the Classical Tongue 
with a male voice. If Majorian would ever enter the annals of history, 
it would be through their melodious voice that could conquer any soul with 
both its range and its power. Through Claradore's patronage, Majorian became the 
capital's foremost singer, their performance attracting dignitaries, courtiers, merchants, nobles and children alike in the Palace Complex's amphitheater.

Nix jumped into their arms, letting her lips meet theirs.

"How fared your play?" said Nix.

"The children fancied it. Though I tire of playing the Firstborn. Melina has slain me forty-eight times this year as the Goddess." They inspected the sleeves and fabric of Nix's dress. "Quite the original attire you are wearing."

"Tell me I wear it better than that simpering princess."

"You always burned brighter than the princess. She is but a mere candle to your 
brazier."

Nix blushed, planting another kiss on his lips.
To Majorian, Nix must have appeared like an Elysian 
princess. They said that the Emperor of Kings Nosrau's line descended from the Firstborn's celestial domain. They were angels that brought salvation to the 
Elysian populace, liberating them from the Goddess' tyranny. Any mortal would be in awe before these angelic beings.

"I have heard you and Serena have had no success with the medallion," said Majorian.

"Zhapur informed me it relates to a certain Elysian empress. Aishula, they called her. There is nothing in the archives. No records. As if she never existed." said Nix.

"I am to perform at Kornikus' Villa in a few months. The Elysian patricians will gather there—the Emperor of Kings celebrates his ascension."

"And why should I bother with an old man's celebration? The Emperor of Kings is far away."

"The patricians are old families. Someone will remember an empress the archives forgot."

"The Goddess knows why my medallion is related to her."

"Perhaps you're her long-lost daughter. Wouldn't that be a tale for a singer such as me?"

Nix glared at them. "This is not a fairy tale."

Domitian clasped her hands with theirs, gripping her with both a woman's delicateness and a man's strength.
"But you would like it to be. Would you prefer me a prince on a white horse?"

"I do not deny it."

Majorian's voice shifted higher, taking on a woman's cadence. "And what if I was a princess instead of a prince? What then?"

"Why do you entertain that thought? You can be anyone you desire."

"I cannot. The Faith will burn me at the stake."

"The witch burns beside the abomination at the pyre. This is why we light candles for Claradore's victory."

"So we can be two princesses?"

"Any throne would buckle under two princesses kissing on it."

"But it is the Emperor who defines the decrees, the rules, the law. We could stop the killing of people of my kind."

"Claradore will remake this world in his image. He has already saved you and gave you a purpose."

"He is but a collector of broken bizarre things. We are all incongruities that he rescued. Let us be realistic. He will ask sacrifices out of us in return."

"That is why we only belong in the Red Guild. 
Not even our own parents wanted us."

Majorian gave a smile full of melancholy. He sniffed Nix's or rather Livia's 
sweat and perfume that still clung to the dress. "May I call you my Lady while you are wearing Livia's clothes?"

My Lady. Two words that sent tremors of pleasure down Nix's spine. Yes, that was 
what she aspired to be named. If only everyone could refer to her by those two words. Nix was destined for royalty. All bones and flesh within her very being clamored for the divine right to rule.

Nix cleared her throat. "You are clever one. Words don't sway me so easily." said Nix in the Classical Tongue with a flawless imitation of Livia's voice.

"Livia, I am but a simple soldier. Do not use such vocabulary with me,"
answered Majorian as Domitian.

"Your colossal stupidity is why I chose you."

Majorian puffed their cheeks, posturing their shoulders to accentuate 
their muscles in the same manner as Domitian.
"Livia, please! I am the Magister Militum, the highest ranking military man in the 
Empire! You must show me the respect I deserve!"

"You did not attain it by merit but by woos. My father chose you over Ordogan after I begged him day and night."

Both Nix and Majorian burst into incontrollable laughter. The absence of Livia 
and her fiancee was a golden opportunity to practice their skills in the theater.
Pretending to be a Purpleborn was a hobby as addictive as magic mushroom. 
Everything was simpler when one could throw denarii at any problem. 

"The Known World will never understand us. It is sad," said Majorian.

Majorian's eyes peered at the crown Nix was wearing.

"My Lady fancies a throne?"

Nix blushed. What would they want as an answer? The answer was obvious to her. 

"An Elysian on the Medean throne? You still speak about fairy tales," said Nix.

"Fairy tales can come to pass. You have heard the prophecy."

_An Elysian will rule the Known World_ thought Nix, a fantasy all Elysian monarchs 
believed in for the past three centuries. It poisoned their bloodline, causing 
them to wage war against the Medean Empire. All imagined themselves to the one 
who would seize Thanatopolis.

"They are fairy tales because reality is a cruel mistress," said Nix.

"A mistress everyone forcibly weds."

"Clever poetry. Would it please you to recite some for me?"

Before they could soothe her with songs, the sound of boots clattering in the corridor alerted her. Nix scoured the room. Majorian gasped as her hands dragged them under Livia's bed. His breath was pressed against her left hand.

Two sets of boots entered the tiled floor. Nix deduced they were Excurbitores by the weight of their footsteps. 

"I swore someone yelped here," said one Excurbitore in the Imperial Tongue with a thick Clovian accent.

"Must have been rats," said a second Excurbitore with a Rauthengardian accent.

"Inform the emperor that rat catchers will be needed."

"We may need more than rat catchers. Two of our own have not returned in days."

"Deserters. They left their gold in their quarters. We may seize it."

The Excurbitores circled the room. "No, they were exploring the Exiles' Island. There is something lurking there, I tell you. We must scour 
the place."

"Your imagination runs wild. The turncloaks have left the city."

"No, no, no, it must be a monster. The rumors are rampant about this place. People can hear monsters slithering within the walls."

Their boots left the room. Nix and Majorian laid for minutes under the bed, 
hearing their tense breathing. 
They only extirpated themselves out of their hiding place once no sound could be 
heard from the corridor.

"Our lives could have been forfeited," said Majorian.

That was an exaggeration. She could have always used magic to wiggle herself out of this
peril.

"There is beauty in danger," said Nix.

"What?"

"You are a soldier, are you not? Do not lie to me. The thrill of danger arouses you."

"Only the craven seeks violence."

"Do not bore me with morality."

Majorian's nose stood inches away from hers. His clove scented 
breath made her heart palpitate. 
Nix touched his warm hand. Sweat ran from his forehead. They slowly tip toed towards the door, locking it. 

"Do you wish to continue our little play?" Nix said.

"Only if I get to be Livia this time?" said Majorian 
with their female voice.

"Calamitous! There cannot be two of me!" said Nix as Livia. 

"Fool! Don't you see? The Goddess has granted me the ability to 
perfect my self-adulation!"

"If I am so enamored with myself, why shouldn't I bed myself?"

"What a brilliant observation, other Livia! Shall we?"

Nix snickered. Her lips closed the distance. Nix tasted Majorian's sweetness, rivaling the finest wine. 
Their hands grabbed her waist. She felt their breath on her neck. Nix snuffed the candle on Livia's desk as they sauntered into the bed.
