She cradled Spartak in her arms, walking in this wretched monotony that was now her life. #emph[Baba...] Home...She wanted to go home. Above, the sky always seemed dark now, no matter how blue Claradore said it was. The black crows that flew overhead hid whatever sunlight the Goddess shed on the path her body walked on without her permission.

#emph[How did it come to this?] The first morning without Baba waking her up. The first day without a breakfast on the table she had come to know. The first day without access to Baba’s arsenal of kitchen tools. The first day without climbing the spiral staircase, reaching for Baba’s book collection. The first night without a bedtime story. This surreal sentiment of living in a dream. Nix’ body moved on its own. Her mind loitered around, the villagers’ deranged screams and Baba’s bones’ snapping echoing in her ears.

#emph[How could they hate us so much?]

"Hear me now, a new decree I lay upon you: Love one another as I have loved you. Let it be your shield and your flag of honor. By this shall the realms of men know you as my true heirs—not by blood, nor by steel, but by the love you bear each other. So it shall be spoken; so it shall be done," said the Goddess to the army Regnant the Dragonslayer amassed at the end of the Age of Magic. The Man in White, he said they were all children of the Goddess. #emph[Why? Why do they hate us then?]

Her encyclopedias always mentioned violence in this rather casual manner. She knew wars happened and that men died. Yet wars and battles had been something of the distant past to her, something rare and foreign that Baba’s abode was immune to. To read this one line in a book in contrast with what The Faith had done to Baba… Nix could never fathom the extent of human brutality. That none of the adults that followed the Man in White thought to save her nor Baba like in the stories she was told …That they actually cheered as Baba agonized before their very eyes. It was unbelievable.

"You will not find any answers, thinking about it, my dear… Baba has proven herself to be weak...And the weak get beaten," Claradore said, offering her a fruit. "You should eat..." Spartak barked, her only cue to accept the food. Had one apple always been enough to fill her stomach? She had never realized how heavy an apple could be while digesting one and that it could be without a taste. Anything now weighed at least six times more and tasted the same. Drinking and eating were now necessities she had no concern for.

#emph[Baba...] Baba, a word that twisted the dagger the Man in White left in her soul. Baba, a word she would never say to Baba ever again. Claradore had healed her leg but the memory of flames ravaging her home eroded her like waves against a promontory. Eventually, she would fall down in the turpid ocean. Maybe that was a good thing as she would see Baba again.

"I want to go home," Nix said, her eyes fixated on the crows which now battled a dove in the sky. Their plumage...Black had never been as beautiful. She had been a fool to believe that yellow was her favorite color. Yellow, its brightness now irritated her beyond rationality. #emph[Baba always wore black.]

He patted her head. His touch was gentle so far. She stank of ashes and she knew it. He would not accept any of her apologies. "I’m sorry...You and I both saw what happened to your home..." he said.

Nix wept, causing Spartak to whimper. The sight of Baba’s body. This never happened in her fairy tales. Somebody should have saved her. #emph[This is unfair!] All her mind could do was show the body again and again. A page in a terrible children’s book that she could not turn, one that begged her to stay. Nothing. Night, day, wind, water, no element could delete this page from this nightmarish book. She screamed, ousting a flock of crows from their perches, hoping the extent of her rage would resuscitate the dead. The Goddess had to know. She had to know what pain her children had caused. #emph[You didn’t do anything, Goddess! Why! Why! WHY!]

Claradore hugged her. His arms were stronger, that she could tell. While they lacked the finesse of Baba’s embrace, they compensated with this tightness, the same feeling Regnant the Dragonslayer had when he first put on his dragonscale armor. Her bedtime hero had felt unbreakable, invincible when he had charged against the enemies of the Goddess. She could cry here to her heart’s contents and so she did, emptying herself on his chest. Never had she screamed so much in her entire life. Sleep had become near impossible without her bunk bed. Cooking was an ordeal without Baba’s elaborate kitchen set, one as extensive as a Sarvitarian legionnaire’s arsenal of spears and swords. Even peeing without Baba’s toilet...A confort she would never have again.

"Please...You know magic...Bring her back..." Nix said.

"If only it was that simple, my dear...You have known Baba longer than I ever had… Even if we could, what would she have said if you managed to drag her soul back from the Gates of the Underworld? Will she still cherish you, the one that prevented her from being reunited with her parents, her lover and the daughter she had to kill...Oh? Oh, you didn’t know, did you? She never told you? There is a reason tampering with the dead was forbidden in the Age of Magic. The dead must be allowed to cross the Gates so the living can continue their voyage," said Claradore as he let go of her. Magic. She saw that book he kept in his backpack. It whispered. It spoke to her with both female and male voices. It called in a tongue she had never learned yet understood.

"The Gates of the Underworld...Where are they?"

Claradore put himself at the same eye level as she did. Spartak licked his cheek. She could not believe how fast her dog had allowed itself to be fed by this stranger. Even though he was not Baba’s son, it was as if Nix saw two of Baba’s brown eye. "My dear, don’t you remember? You have already been there. In fact, both of us have already seen them in person."

#emph[What? I don’t understand.] Riddles and vagueness. This man adored riddles, his tongue delivering one every minute it would seem. Nix now understood why Baba had kicked him out.

He turned his back to her abruptly, his left arm gesturing for her to stay behind him. The book. Claradore unveiled it. As big as one of her encyclopedias, a tarantula was painstakingly drawn on its cover that showed traces of a craftmanship that could not have originated from either Regnassian nor Sarvitarian Empires. A foreign culture, people, their hopes, their stories and their grief, leaked from the papyrus pages. Nix was sure of it. The voices told her so. There was a way to reach the Gates of the Underworld inside.

The ground shook, whatever tremor approached them fast. Spartak barked with apprehension. They were but twenty imperial miles from Miroconium. It had to be the villagers. They had followed her. She started crying again. She could not do it. #emph[Leave me alone!] Why had the Goddess brought Baba to the Gates of the Underworld? Baba who had not wronged her? Metarexia, the Goddess’ residence. Nix would go there one day and demand answers.

The embodiment of years digging into her encyclopedias appeared before her eyes. Four riders , all Molochians emerged, wielding their bows. To her surprise, the infamous Scourge of Goddess had boring faces with short mustaches. Their miserable attempt of having facial hair made her laugh. #emph[Baba was scared of them?] Nix immediately spotted the officer, it was none other than the man who sported the crested helmet on which was embedded rubies and lapis lazuli. He donned a white cape, covering his lamellar armor, on which was painted the Medean crimson phoenix. And the shield, one which still showed the Tiarmat hydra hissing at any opponent who had the misfortune of gazing at it on a battlefield. #emph[A Scholae Palatinae. Baba...The encyclopedia...If only you could see this...]

As for the other Molochians, the books spoke true of them. They were barely taller than Baba. On horseback or on ponyback since Nix refused to consider those tiny mounts as horses, Claradore’s height still appeared higher. Their clothing varied from light and plain tunics to chainmail dubiously acquired from imperial forges. She hoped she would get to see their mounted archery skills. Baba had said that she had tried to imitate their style but had failed when she had sprained her knee while mounting her horse.

Claradore withdrew his spellbook. He turned to her with a friendly smirk. "We shall speak about the book later. Right now, it seems we will reach our destination faster than I have envisioned."

#emph[Destination?] She noticed that she never bothered to ask him where they were going. Baba would have scolded her. Little girls should never trust strangers without a sense of directions, Baba would have said. #emph[Well, I don’t have a choice right now, Baba. Sorry.]

"Where were you intent on taking me?" Nix asked.

"Magister Herbarum, we thought you were at Miroconium...I see your pilgrimage ended early," said the Scholae Palatinae.

"Scholae Palatinae Ordogan, a great pleasure to see you again," said Claradore with the same tone Baba used for sarcasm. #emph[Are you sure Baba that he is not your son?]

"The Emperor requests your immediate presence at Thanatopolis." The man signalled one of the Molochians to bring a riderless horse. "You will follow us."

#emph[The Medean Emperor never takes no for an answer. Thanatopolis... Baba has been there...Are we really going there? Oh, Baba, why? Why couldn’t you be here with me?]

"My, my as direct as always, Ordogan. There is a tiny hiccup: I have brought a student from my pilgrimage, one as talented as I was when I was her age. I humbly ask your permission for her to accompany me on this journey to the capital," said Claradore as he moved sideways, revealing Nix to the soldiers.

"An Elysian? This far away from home?" muttered one of the Molochians in a heavily accented Imperial Tongue. Such an outrageous pronunciation would have grated Baba’s ears.

Ordogan unmounted his horse. Claradore gestured for Nix and Spartak to come closer to the riders. To her surprise, the Scholae Palatinae knelt before her before saying something she did not understand. Seeing her reaction, he repeated the same syllables to no avail.

"He asked for your name in Elysian. Do not worry, my dear, I intend to teach you that language," said Claradore in the Classical Tongue. She saw that Ordogan’s eyes had widened. The other Molochians shouted in disbelief.

"The girl has lost someone dear to her recently. Please be kind to her," continued Claradore.

"My condolences for your loss," said Ordogan in the Classical Tongue. The Scholar Palatinae presented his water bottle before her. Her entire body told her that she had already heard his voice once, somewhere, some time. Her memory had reacted the same way when she saw Claradore on that horrible day. #emph[How?]

"My name is Nix, sir Scholae," said Nix who drank copiously from Ordogan’s bottle.

"Spoken like a native. She even puts Nosrau’s ambassadors to shame! Why don’t we sell her to the Magister Susurri? She could be of use to him at Persiphon," said one of the Molochians.

"She is a student of mine, not a slave," said Claradore dryly.

Ordogan ordered his men to start trekking. Nix found herself saddled by Claradore. Being on top of another animal, this was a sensation she had not foreseen. Her legs dangling in the open air, the smell of horse manure behind her, being taller than a man for once. The horse’s back made this sort of amateurish massage on her lower body. She smiled. If only Baba could see her at this moment.

"Why don’t we buy a horse," Nix had once asked Baba.

"A horse? What do I look like to you, my gold coin? An equestrian off to ride to battle with a Medean Emperor or with one of those kings from the New Kingdoms? See how you have difficulties potty training Spartak? A horse shits wherever it wants. There is no potty training for that kind of beast," had answered Baba.

Claradore embarked on the horse with her, taking the reins. Before she could even ask how fast they could go, the Molochians yelled one syllable. Her beast started galloping, her ass struggling to stay in contact with the saddle. Nix hugged Claradore for her dear life, her nails almost digging into his thick skin. It was as if she was running as a fox but without any semblance of control over the animal. The fact that it could run at this speed while carrying both her, Spartak and Claradore was flabbergasting. For the first time in a week, she giggled, hoping Baba could see her from beyond the Gates of the Underworld. #emph[I’m going to Thanatopolis after all, Baba.]
