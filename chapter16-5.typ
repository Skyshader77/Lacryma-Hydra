The gigantic dragon skull was brought to Zastrian Cloister's 
marmoreal underground floor. It took a hundred Red Acolytes to drag the 
artifact at night through the capital's streets. Gorgon head pillars supported the structure which had once served as a cistern. Each of the dragon's jaws was larger than Nix's arms.
A single swipe of its wings or tail could hurl dozens of men through the air.
The aroma of dark sorcery still lingered on the bones. Nix knocked on the skull. Not even the best Medean blacksmith could forge a blade capable of piercing a dragon's bones.

"I have made the arrangements. You will be Magister Sursurri," simply said Claradore.

Master of Spies. It was the highest position she could attain as an Elysian. 
Nix did not bother hiding her smile. Her salary would increase more than 
tenfold. This meant that she might no longer need to borrow Livia's clothes and would be able to commission dresses and robes as magnificent as the Purpleborn's.

"Please, I am not worthy of such an honor," Nix said out of politeness.

"It is not a crown, but it will satiate your appetite and mine for the time being."

"I am content with what you have granted me."

Claradore smirked. "Is that what you say when you put the princess's circlet upon your brow?"

She scowled. "You have spied on me?"

"My dear, my Artifices hear and see everything. Your first task is simple: pry every secret out of that Alexander. That man troubles my sleep. He has isolated himself at the Exiles' Island. How the populace remains blind to what he truly is: a Giant walking among men is beyond me."

"Is it of importance if he has made no moves against us."

"A sword that remains sheathed is still a sword. A fleet that never sails is still a fleet. Power held in reserve is the most dangerous power of all."

More Red Acolytes came down the subterranean cavern, Next came the riders' remains. The pair were locked in an embrace, gouges fully visible on their ribcage. The armor they came with intrigued Nix for spider 
insignia was carved on a material not from this epoch. 

"Who were they?" asked Nix.

To her surprise, tears were falling in abundance from Claradore' cheeks. She had never seen him cry. In fact, a man such as him could not be seen in this vulnerable state for it was weakness and the weak...The weak get beaten.

"Claradore..." said Nix.

"Leave me...All of you..." said Nix.

They had supped on broiled lobster tails, oxtail soup and larks dipped in butter. Every dish came with a different wine.  The Regular Hag was Thanatopolis' most well known tavern. Serena, Nix and Majorian spent a month worth of their salary for a table usually reserved for patricians. The hydra banners of the old Tiarmat Empire still hung on the walls, clinging on to the time where the late Empress Faustina disguised herself as an old woman to eat the tavern's famed seafood dishes in secrecy. Torches and a hearth shed light on the filled tables where men and women of all stations were seated, the myriad of colors of their robes and tunics creating this sort of nightly rainbow within the building.

Serena burped loudly. Eight pints of Vyrmogothian wine laid next to her right hand.

"More wine?" asked Nix.

Serena refilled four pints with what wine remained in the flask. She was cloaked in a man's garb as usual. Purloined wallets and purses bulged from the tunic's pouches.

"To the Red Guild, the sole power behind the throne," said Serena. She clinked her glass with Nix's.

"The princess will not stay idle. Claradore was too kind," said Nix. She cleared her throat, paving the way for her impersonation of the princess' voice. "Mark my words, Claradore, vengeance will be mine! Domitian, lend me that half brain of yours. We need spies. We need allies!" 

"Livia, your schemes are far too complex for my feeble intellect," said Majorian as Domitian. They wore an Elysian man's tunic gifted by Zhapur and Leila. Motifs of dancing gryphons and singing peacocks were sewn on 
the lavish attire.

"Send an embassy to the Rauthengardian and Elysian courts. Surely, we can gather support from their monarchs. Or no, find a suitable partner for my brother. Surely there must be nobles who would love the idea of becoming Purpleborn." Nix bit her nails furiously in the same manner as Livia. "Yes, find a loving princess from one of our vassal states and have her enter my brother's bed. He will not be able to resist her charms. " Nix then cackled maniacally with Livia's voice. 

"My dear Purpleborn, have you considered the possibility that I have already foreseen your plan?" said Serena as Claradore. Serena leaped off her chair. She traveled the alleys with the Crimson Spider's gait before returning to her place.
"While I am not copulating with virgins, I see and hear everything, my dear."
Majorian and Nix guffawed at the flawless performance.

"Calamitous! We cannot let competent appointees lead our nation to prosperity,"
said Nix as Livia.

"Yes, Livia, we need strong, muscular, bulky men that only know how to wage war and commit adultery at the front such as I," said Majorian as Livia with a wide grin on their face.

Nix's jaw dropped, imitating Livia's mask when the princess had to feign offense.

"You have broken your vows?!?"

"That aberration of a singer witnessed everything at the Elysian border. Do not fear, my love. Her breasts were not as perky as yours."

"What an idiot of a man you are, my love."

"But...But you said my colossal stupidity is why you chose me."

Serena burst into uncontrollable laughter, almost falling off her chair.

"What comes next?" asked Majorian. 

"It is hard to believe Claradore has further need of you two. Don't you grow tired of dancing at court?" said Serena.

"Claradore will make me Magister Sursurri," said Nix.

Serena raised an eyebrow.

"So he ties you to his fate at court. You are already entangled in the spider's web since infancy."

"Performing in front of emperors and kings is tiresome," admitted Majorian. They rested their head on Nix's shoulders.

"Do not tell both of you will leave the capital!" said Nix.

"A storm is coming. It is best to leave before the gales arrive," said Serena as 
she finished the last of the four pints she had refilled. Majorian silently nodded.

"This is inaccurate," said Nix. Her friends had not accessed the situation correctly. With the Red Guild comfortable at the helm of the throne, the galley that was the Medean Empire would never see troubled waters. Any whirlpool, rogue wave or cyclone would be no match for Claradore's captaining skills. 

"Have you not seen the armories churning out lances, arrows and swords by the thousands? The dockyards have not had so many dromons and quadriremes since the age of Sarvitar. Have you read the edict you write? The army's size is to double in five years. Claradore's intentions for the Known World are obvious to anyone."

"It is defensive posturing."

Majorian chuckled. "Nix, I may not be versed in geopolitics as you and Serena are. The Known World has known peace for twenty years. Why mass an army now?"

Serena's eyes light up as if she had come up with the solution to global poverty. "He wants the Elysian throne, not just the Medean throne. And I believe he now has the means to do so should Ordogan become Magister Militum."

"Ludicrous. The Medean Empire has no candidate to install on the Sapphire Throne,"
said Nix.

"Oh, I see. He has not told you, has he?" 

Nix frowned. She did not like the tone of that voice. "What are you insinuating, Serena?"

Serena swallowed another pint. "My dear, I do not wish to soil your evening at Kornikus' Villa. All will be revealed there," said Serena as a parody of Claradore's mannerisms.

_I thought we had finished impersonating Claradore,_ thought Nix.

Serena put her hand on Nix, letting her fingers conduct acrobatics over Nix's own fingers. Majorian watched the spectacle with fascination. "Please, Phoenix, leave with us once you return from Kornicus' Villa."
