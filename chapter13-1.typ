Serena had seen the tentacle drag the Emperor down the abyss. Hydras could be reckless but this...This was an anomaly. She had watched from her perch the Excubitores Majorian grab the Emperor's leg, dragging himself and Nix into the well. If Nix had 
not desired to become the heroine of the day, Serena would not have intervened. She had long decided that intervening in mankind's affair was a fruitless endeavor. 

Bells tolled. Serena sat at the top of Zastrian's Cloister, deploying her white swan wings. A snowflake landed on her plumage, sending a pleasant chill down her aging body. Citizens and guards alike rushed to the well. 

"The Emperor disappeared!" a child past her fortieth summer screamed.

"He is all but dead!" another boy in his thirtieth summer shouted.

The guards loitered around the area, fidgeting with their lances and shields to show the pretense of caring. Doves roosted on the Zastrian's Cloister. Serena let one land on her arm. She had always adored their color, the symbol of an utopia she wanted to forge. It was a disappointment that Nix preferred crimson as a color. Serena had seen how Nix' eyes were fixated on the Medean crown. Magi that aspired to wear purple were the most dangerous.

Dusk fell in the capital. The curious children that had agglomerated around the Emperor's well subsided. Word of the incident would have reached Claradore and Livia. 
Serena eagerly awaited the performance her two actors would present. But first, her treasure had to be secured. She spread her wings. Perhaps today was the day she would become a prince 
for Nix and rescue her princess from the Hydra's lair. Nix was a star that radiated its light in the universe's endless nothingness. While wearing Livia's garments, Nix transformed into a supernova that could outlast the end of time and space. Never had the temptation of planting her lips into Nix's had been so difficult to resist. Nix, the reincarnation of her own sister that she had betrayed, now offered her the ultimate chance at redemption.

Serena dived head first into the same well that had swallowed Nix, Majorian and the Emperor. 

She found herself before a simple map of arched corridors and waterways. Unlike the sewers of the Age of Magic, there were no intricate fountains, glowing moths that purified the waters, no intersection with more than eight passages. Children of the Magi could once play within these structures. Visibly, that charm had been lost in the modern age.

Her feet touched the weltering waters. Her toe made a ripple that played water as if it was a harp. Instead of plunging through the surface, she landed on liquid as if it was concrete. What would Nix have said if she knew Serena could race her flying form on foot? 

A battle brewed in the distance. Serena smelled the creature she had awakened. She had no choice. The Gatekeeper has riddled her with two Magis to thread with. The eldest one would be the most problematic. Claradore was a child that evoked both fear and admiration. The day would soon come that she would cross blood with him. She was no longer the slayer of Magis that had to be reckoned with. And so the best was required.

In an ideal world, it would solely satiate its hunger by feeding on rats and roaches. 
But no plan survived the first contact with the shield wall, her thing had tasted human blood somehow. Yes, a child had fallen into its den. A much unfortunate collateral damage. And now the creature clamored for the flesh of Nix. 

Serena walked on the current, letting the screams guide her. She espied Nix's sublime display of artistry. Serena sat down. Every one of Nix' stroke painted a canvass of blood that tore through the Hydra's bones and flesh. Magis infused their hearts and soul into their fighting style. It was this tantalizing work of art that all of the Magi's literature captured every detail with minutiose attention.  This was what the fairy tales of old spoke about, a legacy Serena had been keen to erase in her youth.

Serena noticed the blackish green taint on Nix' lower body. She grinned. A rescue was needed. How would she write the scene? She could not embark on a horse in scale armor and ride against the monster with a lance. Life was not a fairy tale. Nix would collapse momentarily from the poison's effects. In that instant, Serena would intervene, one of her first actions in more than a century. Every bone, tissue and skin pore craved for this moment. She laughed. Only Magi could have made her yearn for a longer life.
