Her brother was praying on top of their father's catafalque. Scented candles burned. Incense. It was always incense. In the ceiling, the incomplete fresco 
of the Goddess' death scrolled from wall to wall. It was intended to depict Serena being cast down from the Heavens by the devilish Cardinals. The anguish and agony were already well painted on Serena's visage. The canvass was only missing Sextus atop, holding a lance that impaled the Goddess.

"Are you asking for father's counsel? I am afraid he will be of little use to us," said Livia.

"It is always worth trying," said Ralens the Younger. 

"Praying will not make him return from the Underworld."

"The Goddess must guide us."

"She is not here."

His eyes narrowed. "Are you certain, sister? You were always the most pious of us."
"Recent events have changed my position. Do you not see the suffering this world endures? How can the Goddess allow it?"

"The Goddess surely has her reasons. The Gospel says misery helps us grow."

Livia muffled a laugh. 

"She only provides that excuse to make us forget her incompetence. Why do you think she allows suffering to exist? Every day, children are dying before they reach their third summer. If she is as omnipotent as they say, why does she not stop it? Let me tell you why: it is because she revels in it."

Ralens was taken back. Her old self has never professed any condemnation of the Goddess. It was rather foolish to entrench oneself in an antiquated opinion in the presence of damning evidence. A wise ruler should always consider new facts and adapt their thought process accordingly.

"You took the words right out of Claradore's lips. Or is it now Ordogan's. They say even Ordogan doubts the Faith," said Ralens.

"Ordogan and I have been in contact regarding the Sextus question," said Livia.

"I was told you Ordogan spends his nights in your room."

"Surely you did not summon me to inquire about my love life."

Livia noted the absence of Excubitores in the room. Ralens had asked that only the two of them be here. What important state matter should only be discussed 
between them?

Ralens raised his palm in the air. He closed his eyes. Livia's own eyes spoke lies for his index finger melted. Then the other fingers followed. She yelled profanities. Ralens rushed to cover her mouth. Her arm hair raised itself. Cool sweat trickled down her back. Her heartbeat roared through its ribcage. She felt the warmth of his hand over her lips.

"Please...Sister...You are the only one I can trust," said Ralens.

_Another Magi? But he was born a non-Magi. Nothing. Nothing makes sense anymore,_ thought Livia. No, there was only one possibility among many. She had sired him somehow. In the history of the Age of Magic, there were rare occurrences of Magi sharing their gift with others. The manners in which this was achieved were lost to mankind forever but Claradore strongly discouraged it. The fewer Magi we were for now, the less uncertainties we have to cope with, my dear, he had said.

"How long have you known..." asked Livia, removing his hand from her mouth.

"Two fortnights. I-I-I was bathing. Then it happened. I d-did not know what to do.I thought I was dreaming. "

_So did I,_ thought Livia.

Th-This is magic isn't it?" asked Ralens.

She clasped his cheeks with her hands. "Listen to me carefully, from now on, we will exactly as I say. Any deviation from my counsel will lead to both of use being burned at the stake."
