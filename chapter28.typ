She laid down on Claradore's bed. It has always amused Livia how mundane the room was. Claradore's cologne, this musky flagrance that reminded her of wood lingered in the air. 
Intricate networks of cobwebs ran from one corner to the next. Flies, ladybugs, 
roaches carcasses littered the webs.  Sandals gifted by the less fortunate pointed towards the exit. 

Eunuchs with spider tattoos loitered around her, pincers in hand.

"This better be as painless as you claim," said Livia.

"My dear, do you still not trust after those eight years?" said Claradore's Artifice.

What she had ordered the Red Guild to perform was a necessary vice. Her body was shared by two entities: one old, one new. While her new self dominated her will, her old self could resurface and derail any carefully thought out plan. It was a weakness that Sextus could exploit should he be made aware of it. Therefore, this risk had to be eliminated.

"Begin," said Livia.

The eunuchs put their hands on her mouth. Her wrists and legs were restrained.
Livia heard her own breath, shutting her eyelids. She had to be one with her liquefied form. She felt her own blood leaving her brain, aggregating within the heart, stomach and lungs. Soon, Livia no longer heard her own heartbeat. Instead, 
hidden in the ventricular cavities, she felt tremors rocking her liquefied being.
It was all quiet. 

Blood surged. It belonged to her vessel. An earthquake shook her hiding place. The body's mouth tried to scream. Her old self now captained the ship she had inherited. Arms and legs flailed. The torso twisted left and right in a frantic manner. _Fight it all you want, you have already lost,_ thought Livia.

Pincers. She felt their hot iron sizzle against the vessel's skin. Her other self 
wanted to shriek in pain. The ship convulsed. She smelled blood and tears. 
It would be the last time her old self would command the galley. Under the previous Livia, this ship had almost capsized. Livia was too wise to repeat the same mistakes. 

Then it happened. A weight that she had to bear for the past days was lifted.
A filament of luminous blue ran from her heart. It wiggled incessantly in the hands of the eunuchs who tried to manipulate it. Her other soul. Inch by inch, 
it was exorcized from her body akin to a parasitic worm. A sense of levity possessed her. She should have done this on the first day. No longer shall another consciousness doubt her intentions.

The other Livia's soul now rested in an eunuch's hands. Livia dismantled her liquefied form, lodging her blood within her vessel's vital organs as she has done before. She soon felt her own toes, her fingers and her arms.

"It is done, my dear. You may now mold her body as you please," said the Artifice.

Livia raised her hand. Her blood vibrated within. All fingers melted. The palm followed. Livia smiled. Who would ever suspect the Empress herself of being a Magi?

" What do you wish to do about her?" said the Artifice. Its reflection could be seen within the depths of the blue light.

"It would be too cruel to have her depart for the Underworld," said Livia.

"She would need a vessel then."

An idea crossed her mind. What if the soul could live in her mother's medallion?
There would be no risk of losing the other Livia.

"Insert it in the medallion," said Livia.

"This is a rather unprecedented request, my dear. The Red Guild can offer storage.
There is a limitless supply of amphoras to be used."

The soul glowed with a renewed vigor at that statement.

"She would want to watch how her life unfolds with me at the helm," said Livia.

She opened the locket. The eunuchs poured the soul inside. The other Livia 
flailed in vain as the Red Guild forced her into her new container. They key was slid inside. A clockwise turn sealed the soul inside its new residence.
A faint glow emanated from the keyhole.

With her other self finding a new habitation, Livia made her way through 
the Palace Complex's halls. Courtiers, eunuchs bowed before her. 

Her brother was praying on top of their father's catafalque. Scented candles burned. Incense. It was always incense. In the ceiling, the incomplete fresco 
of the Goddess' death scrolled from wall to wall. It was intended to depict Serena being cast down from the Heavens by the devilish Cardinals. The anguish and agony were already well painted on Serena's visage. The canvass was only missing Sextus atop, holding a lance that impaled the Goddess.

"Are you asking for father's counsel? I am afraid he will be of little use to us," said Livia.

"It is always worth trying," said Ralens the Younger. 

"Praying will not make him return from the Underworld."

"The Goddess must guide us."

"She is not here."

His eyes narrowed. "Are you certain, sister? You were always the most pious of us."
"Recent events have changed my position. Do you not see the suffering this world endures? How can the Goddess allow it?"

"The Goddess surely has her reasons. The Gospel says misery helps us grow."

Livia muffled a laugh. 

"She only provides that excuse to make us forget her incompetence. Why do you think she allows suffering to exist? Every day, children are dying before they reach their third summer. If she is as omnipotent as they say, why does she not stop it? Let me tell you why: it is because she revels in it."

Ralens was taken back. Her old self has never professed any condemnation of the Goddess. It was rather foolish to entrench oneself in an antiquated opinion in the presence of damning evidence. A wise ruler should always consider new facts and adapt their thought process accordingly.

"You took the words right out of Claradore's lips. Or is it now Ordogan's. They say even Ordogan doubts the Faith," said Ralens.

"Ordogan and I have been in contact regarding the Sextus question," said Livia.

"I was told you Ordogan spends his nights in your room."

"Surely you did not summon me to inquire about my love life."

Livia noted the absence of Excubitores in the room. Ralens had asked that only the two of them be here. What important state matter should only be discussed 
between them?

Ralens raised his palm in the air. He closed his eyes. Livia's own eyes spoke lies for his index finger melted. Then the other fingers followed. She yelled profanities. Ralens rushed to cover her mouth. Her arm hair raised itself. Cool sweat trickled down her back. Her heartbeat roared through its ribcage. She felt the warmth of his hand over her lips.

"What in the Goddess' name?" Livia whispered.

"Please...Sister...You are the only one I can trust," said Ralens.

_Another Magi? But he was born a non-Magi. Nothing. Nothing makes sense anymore,_ thought Livia. No, there was only one possibility among many. She had sired him somehow. In the history of the Age of Magic, there were rare occurrences of Magi sharing their gift with others. The manners in which this was achieved were lost to mankind forever but Claradore strongly discouraged it. The fewer Magi we were for now, the less uncertainties we have to cope with, my dear, he had said.

A pragmatic decision would be to eliminate him now. It would be quick and simple.
But Livia could not help but notice the advantages this transitory situation offered her. Surely the Faith and Sextus also dealt with undefined variables. Who would profit the most from chaos? The orderly Faith bound in tradition or the reborn Magi who were birthed in anarchy?

"How long have you known..." asked Livia, removing his hand from her mouth.

"Two fortnights. I-I-I was bathing. Then it happened. I d-did not know what to do.I thought I was dreaming. "

_So did I,_ thought Livia.

She clasped his cheeks with her hands. "Listen to me carefully, from now on, we will exactly as I say. Any deviation from my counsel will lead to both of use being burned at the stake."

He nodded warily.

"Can you confirm you have spoken to no one else about this?" asked Livia.

"I know what the Faith treats those accused of witchcraft. Th-This is magic isn't it?"

"A Purpleborn who became a Maig. You would be the envy of many poets."

"Not if I burn at the pyre."

"You wield both magic, wealth and armies."

"I never asked for any of those."

_The nerve,_ thought Livia. The ultimate prize she has climbed a mountain of skulls to acquire was belittled in such a manner. She could have slapped him.
But she saw value in harnessing his new talents. They only had a month. Was it sufficient to teach him cants and spells she took years to master? If only Baba could watch her from the Gates of the Underworld. The student has become the master. 

"You fail to understand, do you? That man, Sextus, now has reason to fear you. 
The Goddess has granted you the power to bury our enemies," said Livia.

"We-We can make him go away? I am only one man!"

"You are wrong. I stand with you as I always have. In fact, we now share something in common, brother."

His eyes widened. 

"Do not tell me..." he stammered.

She went for a hug. Her lips came close to his ears.

"Let me share with you a secret. You are not the only Magi here, brother."
