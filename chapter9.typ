"Guess who it is?" said a cheerful voice in the Imperial Tongue as they ambushed Nix, putting their warm hands over her eyes.

"The useless Goddess?" said Nix.

"Why would you say that, Phoenix?"

"My vision vanished suddenly like she did a millennium ago."

The girl with tousled curls removed her hands off Nix’ face. Brown eyes brightened a smirk Nix all too well. Serena leapfrogged over her, proudly displaying the new men’s tunic Nix had bought for her. A phantom these clothes allowed her to become, letting her hands pursue this habit that caused them to roam free in the treasure troves that were her victims’ pockets. How many times Nix had to trip Vigiles who were inclined to put wrenches in the cogs of Serena’s antics.

"It’s my hands Nix! I cannot stop them!" had pleaded Serena before Nix’ accusatory gaze. They had played the game of judge and bandit countless times as children with Nix sinking the vast armada of Serena’s ludicrous excuses and alibis every time.

"May I remind you that the hands are connected to the brain."

"Do not bring biology in this, Phoenix. We are talking about Medean law."

Hopeless. The day someone would bring Serena to a proper court, she would boil faster than eggs in the oppressive summer. Thankfully for Nix, Serena had promised to pay her five years worth of her salary should she accept to be her lawyer.

#emph[But I am not a lawyer.]

"It does not matter! We promised remember? We face the toughest trials in unity."

"I remember."

That promise she had made when she first came to Thanatopolis eight years ago. Both of them had been eleven summers then. Baba would have never let her play with someone who carried a hidden dagger such as Serena. Someone who revolved around distrust could not be trusted. At least, that was what Serena had disproved. Who knew Baba could be wrong at times?

The sea caressed Nix’ feet. Seagulls and waves sang their usual symphony. Sunrise glimmered in the horizon, a destination for this adventure she was going to undertake.

"What did you want to show me, Phoenix?" said Serena, sunlight magnifying her visage lit by curiosity. It was not the bloody harpoons. Nix had demonstrated that aptitude to the point of boredom. No, today was the day she would make Serena’s eyeballs somersault out of their sockets.

Nix breathed. She closed her eyes. A net of red descended over her eyelids, allowing morning’s cool air through her searing lungs. Her spine tingled as the sensation she had been building demanded to be let free. Clavicles and scapulas cracked. Nix heard her own heartbeat, that domesticated beast that all magicians had to assert their control over should they ever want to succeed. It beat in an odd rhythm, this bowstring pattern that vibrated that sometimes both flirted and rammed her ribcage. Blood was redirected to her back, expanding and expanding. Her imagination was the will bending the crimson substance as it created layers of feathers. Condensation touched every feather, Nix feeling the detail of the water’s salty complexion. Her blood coursed through those feathers, coalescing them into eight panaches.

The sound of frenzied applause caused her to open her eyes. Nix swore she could see tears on Serena’s face. Her spectator wasted no time in rewarding her with a hug. Nix shrieked. Her panaches could be ripped by such sheer force.

"Amazement is an understatement for what you have just showed me, Phoenix."

Nix blushed. Baba would have drawn a painting of her on the spot. The first time one used a spell of such magnitude was a moment to be cherished. If the hug was not enough, Serena’s fingers had started a pernicious assault on the feathers, sending waves after waves of tickling infantrymen through Nix’ veins. Nix cursed. The panaches did not come with titanic defenses such as the Marroan Walls. She faltered as her single audience buried her hands and faces within her back, lauding the softness of Nix’s work of art.

"Stop it! Stop it! Th-Th-That tickles!"

"Being short-tempered already, are we? No, no, no, you don’t get to snap at me with this delightful duvet. One can make a bed out of this!"

"My magic is not for sale!"

"How did you get Claradore to teach you this?"

Claradore. Even eight years later, Nix had yet to rival his mastery of the magical arts. For Claradore’s feathers were formed by precise octagonal patterns. While hers were brittle, his could withstand the most lethal of fires. He chose to amass his feathers in the manner of a lost peafowl, one who had strayed away from its homeland, one which yearned for the colors it had never encountered and for the colors it would never see again. When one looked at Claradore’s panache, one could only bend the knee before his dazzling plumage, its iridescence accentuated by shades of dark violet, fuchsia and scarlet.

#emph[Do not get me started on how he flies...]

"Do you want to fly?" asked Nix.

Serena’s eyes and mouth betrayed disbelief and anticipation. "Am I dreaming? I should be waking up."

"Do you trust me?"

"Always. I will always trust this Phoenix."

Nix leapt into the air. Her wings flapped. Her blood assimilated every gust. Toes dangled in midair. Hair danced, conducted by wind currents. She giggled, rolling a 360 rotation on both her longitudinal and lateral axes. Fly. If only Baba could have seen her at this very instant. She could have flown with Nix too. Quadruple somersaults, nosedives towards Serena, Nix showcased everything. Her favorite maneuver was this half of a loop that would bring her completely inverted. She would then roll to the upright position resulting in her flying in the opposite direction at a higher altitude. Claradore had told her that dragons had been trained to perform this maneuver flawlessly during the Age of Magic.

"You should be generous when having fun!" screamed Serena from the ground. Life as a non-Magi must be uninteresting, for ordinary humans would never be liberated from the shackles of gravity.

Of course, Nix had forgotten. She had to go somewhere today. Her feet tingled before melting. Their blood gushed, reforming themselves into talons. Nix felt her new claws, weapons that could dig into ripe flesh should she wish. Weapons that sacrificed balance for precision. A bird of prey she had become, one that could finally challenge the Faith’s dove.

"Someone likes Phoenixs," said Serena. It was true. With her crimson plumage, one could have mistaken her for the Medean emblem.

Nix swooped in, grabbing Serena by the waist. She flew. A chorus of laughter accompanied their flight as they tested the limits of human acrobatics in the air. Serena extended her air, looking back at Nix with this radiant smile. They soared amidst the seagulls, the pigeons, joining flocks of migrating birds. They tasted the acrid water of clouds as they traversed them, Serena pretending to swim across the masses of water vapor, comically flailing her arms and legs. When they wished, they nosedived into the sea, both of them trying to seize a fish with their mouths. If pelicans could it, why could they not? Of course, Baba would have told Nix that birds were created specifically to catch prey by their mouth. Humans had other tools at their disposal. This was such an injustice imposed by the Goddess. Who never wished they could become a bird and fly to escape the confines of life on land. Nix and Serena made their best imitations of howling eagles as they plunged into the waters. They would tire themselves of the taste of raw shrimps and algae. They jumped from water to air, from air to water akin to flying fish, letting the streams of cold and torrid fluid flow over their unworried bodies.

"We should do this every day," said Serena.

"You said the same thing with the blood harpoons," said Nix.

"Do you think we can see the Goddess’ Domain if we keep climbing, Phoenix?"

"Why would you submit yourself to such an ordeal?"

"I dunno, she might know who the Man in White is, where he lives, where he shits, how he fucks..."

To which, Claradore would have answered. "All that draws breath is wrought for the grave. We are bound since the end of Age of Magic to this wheel of flesh and blood, of birth and passage through the Gates of the Underworld. Is this the Goddess’ curse upon us? I often wonder of the deity who gladly gave us this riddle... and whether my mortal hands might one day rise to eviscerate her."

The corpse hung from the Hollow Tree. Untouched after all those eight years. Tattered remnants of cloth covered a severed rib cage. A sign had been atrociously placed around the neck: WITCH. Nix’ blood boiled as she surveyed the lilacs, amaranths, orchids, hyacinths and plumerias that made their peace with the charred grounds they had grown from.

"Nix...You have not said a word in a hour...What are we doing near Miroconium?"

Miroconium. A flood had ended the town’s ignoble life two years after her and Claradore had started their extended hiking trip. The Empire’s archives stopped there. No mentions of the bishops who served. No mentions of witches that had been slain. The Man in White had under any reasonable assumptions fled.

"Bring me wood, any kind," said Nix dryly.

Serena’s face brimmed with joy as she piled branches, logs and dead roots beneath the hanged body. Back in what used to be a house, Nix’ memory struggled to reconstitute a place she had lived in for eleven summers. The staircase with the uneven step should have been of the left side of the first floor. Had the kitchen always been so minuscule? A shimmer of light caught her eye. It rested deep within a spider’s nest or rather, it was the spider’s nest. Broodlings escaped the keyhole she had not seen in years. The female tarantula sat upon the Elysian griffon carved into silver as if it wanted to protect the jewelry from unfit claimants. Her mother’s medallion. This was intentional. Thieves would have long looted the premises.

#emph[Why now?]

Behind her, Serena had brought the corpse down. The most beautiful fire Nix had ever made was lit. Fireflies flew around the brazier. Serena held her hand unquestionably. When Nix imagined tears on her own face, she was met with a hug. Silphium. It all smelled of silphium.

"You noticed did you not? The skull..."

The skull was absent. Saw marks had been introduced on the spine. Nix collected the ashes in an urn. She denied crying throughout the entire journey back to Thanatopolis.
