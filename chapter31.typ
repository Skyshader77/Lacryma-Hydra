A year had passed since she last stood before Ralens the Elder's catafalque.
Only a month remained before Sextus would resolve his ultimatum. All of her 40 000
men had arrived at the capital. Her brother prayed before the coffin, a futile exercise in her opinion. He was dressed in a purple tunic, his crown was deposited on the catafalque.

The mausoleum's dampness clung to her skin. The stench of incense was palpable.

"What would Father have done in this situation, sister?" asked Ralens.

"Surely no better than what we have done," said Livia. 

"I am ready to face Sextus," said Ralens.

"We have already discussed this. On the day of reckoning, our army will form a battle line in front of the Faith's camp. The Alchemist's Guild will provide all of the necessary assistance against the Margrub Dogas."

"No, one more month is too much. Look at our granaries, sister. Within one week, they will be emptied."

"The shipments from Noein will arrive shortly."

"Have you seen their faces? The people glare at us, sister."

All the more reason why coming here was a dangerous endeavor. Grain and fish were requisitioned to feed the Medean and Faith's hosts. The illusion of collaboration costed dearly to the commoner. To them it must have seemed as if both state and religion were willingly starving them. They ignored the complexities of meshing  magic and geopolitics. Within a month, the fruits of Livia and Ordogan's plans would blossom.

Ralens had suggested coming here while wearing commoners' clothes. Livia declined that suggestion. She was now an Empress and would dress like one for the rest of her life.

"Let them glare. We have distributed enough pamphlets blaming this crisis on the Faith," said Livia.

"It is not enough. They are suffering. I see famished women holding babes in their hands," said Ralens.

"One month, brother and all of our fates will be decided by then."

"How are you so certain of victory?"

_The Giant expects magic to be his downfall. In guarding against magical forces, 
he left himself defenseless against conventional weaponry,_ thought Livia.

"I have calculated all possibilities," said Livia. It was true. She had spent countless nights practicing her impersonation of Sextus. How he thought, how he shat, how he walked, all elements of his character were used to emulate his decision-making. Livia played the role of Sextus while Ordogan led the Medean army
. War was a game where any enemy would seek to minimize your score while you sought to optimize yours. One could draw a diagram with each of your own decision branching out to a series of your enemy's decision. This would result in a wide tree where all end nodes led to either a Medean victory or annihilation. Values could then be assigned to each node, representing the achieved score. Without enough nodes, all of Sextus' reactions that consisted of reaching the lowest possible utility value were analyzed. 

Therefore, what had been an unknown less than a year ago became a constant. Sextus had granted them six months. Livia and Ordogan had dissected the Giant's mentality. All actions they would undertake on the day of reckoning would result in an outcome that maximized their utility value. There would be no mistakes. 

"There is no such thing as absolute when threading with magic," said Ralens.

"You took Claradore's words out of his mouth. Do you trust me so little?" asked Livia.

"I trust in magic. Mark my words. I will vanquish him sister."

The Excubitores burst through the door. Their lances were soaked in blood.

"Your August Majesty. We must leave now!"

There was a sense of urgency in his voice. Ralens and Livia left through the entrance. Before the mausoleum's steps, a grotesque hydra amassed before them. Faces deformed by zealotry and despair leered. Knives flashed. Clubs were raised. In the law of divine right, the populace attributed their misfortunes to the Emperor. They were not wrong, but Livia could not allow them to be right.

The Excubitores raised their shields. 

"The demons feast while we starve!" cried a Faithful.

"They have brought this calamity upon us!" yelled another woman.

"Monster breeders! Scions of the Magi!"

The hydra smelled of sweat and piss. Livia revealed her concealed knife. The Palace Complex never felt so far away here in front of Zastrian's Cloister. 

"Calm yourselves! There is ample grain! The dole will be doubled for the week!" screamed her brother.

They did not understand. No one could. The crown was pouring its blood and grain into its armies. Was this another one of Sextus' methods to hasten their search?
The Giant could create human monsters as well it seemed.

A man grabbed her hand. His eyes wandered down her neck. _Disgusting,_ she thought. She swiped at him. Blood gushed from his throat. The hydra roared.

"Kill the Purpleborn! Kill! Kill! Kill!"

And so knives and clubs collided with the Excubitores' shield wall. Each step forward resulted in a torrent of hacked limbs. Livia lost count of the number of men and women she had stabbed. Behind her, Ralens clung to her dress. Why had he not brought a dagger? The shield wall progressed through the Road of Sarvitar. 
Some of her men wandered too far away, possessed by the blood lust that overcame any man on a battlefield. She would watch them swing their axe or mace into the mass of human flesh before them. At times, she pulled them back into the formation. Others were not so fortunate. Like legionnaires of old facing hordes of barbarians, they would fell dozens before being surrounded, collapsing out of exhaustion.

The shadow of the Palace Complex drew ever closer. Sweat dripped from her forehead. Her rose dress was stained by feces and blood. Livia felt her brother's grip loosen. Gaspard had grabbed the Emperor's ankle. 

"What are you doing Gaspard?" she hissed.

The commander of the Men of the Crucible unceremoniously tossed her brother into the hydra's jaws. Livia shrieked. Her legs sprinted outside of the shield wall's safety.

Her arms found her brother's scalp. He cried out in horror. Filthy hands were all over her skin and clothes. She slashed. There were too may of them. The shield wall moved further and further away from their position. Livia panted. The dozens of rioters surrounded them. Lecherous sharks circled them, waiting for her guard to be lowered. She analyzed every step. Their gait indicated their intentions. 
Time was on their side. Night would come soon.

"We have to move, brother," Livia said.

"And how do we propose we do that, sister?" asked Ralens.

Always with the difficult questions. In truth, she was hoping Ordogan would be alerted to the riots by now. Her ears listened for the clattering of hooves. _Look at myself, waiting for the cataphracts to come,_ thought Livia.

His eyes gave her a look ridden with despair. Livia did not like it. She let out a litany of curses when his arm liquefied itself. The crowd gasped. A blood blade was in his hands. All the Underworld broke loose at that instant.

"Run!" he had said as he unleashed a carnival of blood blades on the rioters.
Livia thought it's best to obey that command.

Livia washed her makeup in the garden she chose as a refuge. She had thrown 
her blood-stained purple garments into an empty basket and borrowed a man's tunic. 
The owner would not mind. She longed for a shower, yet her current stench could 
help her elude her pursuers.

She had run. The mob' calls for her death had echoed behind her footsteps. Never had 
being an empress in broad daylight been such a hurdle. People had stared. People had talked 
through the labyrinth of narrow streets. Who would not hand her over to the Goddess 
for a few bullions?

Smoke. Trails of smoke arose from neighboring streets. The Faithful had done it.
Self-destruction was on their agenda. Was tearing everything apart the only 
thing they were competent at? 

Livia doubted she could return to the palace before nightfall not while prowlers 
sang the Faith's hymns in the streets. She took a deep breath,
hoping that her brother had made it out alive.

She drank water from a flask, sitting on the same tapestry that she had sat on 
every time she came to this house. It was only now that she found the erotic 
paintings on the wall risible and wondered if they were the last piece of art 
she would 
see in her life.

Zhapur dropped his grocery bags when he saw her.


"Who are you?" the Elysian doctor said in the Classical Tongue.


"You don't recognize me?" said Livia in the Elysian Tongue 
with Nix' voice.


If Zhapur's jaws could touch the ground, 
they would have done so at that very instant. 
"Nix? Nix! 
The Firstborn be damned, your face...I did not even recognize it...
How can you change your eye color? What kind of makeup or herb is that?" 


"I need a favor...They are after me."


"I don't understand. But those ruffians, 
they are after the Empress."

"You do not need to understand. It is me they want. They will search your 
house as they are doing with every house in the street."


Zhapur stroked his beard while looking around him. The distant shouts of 
men demanding access to homes in the name of The Goddess caused Livia to 
shiver. 

"The Firstborn be damned! How would you hide here? You look nothing like Leila."

"I have an idea," Livia said while glancing at the different sexual positions 
shown in Zhapur's guest room.

\medskip

"You can't possibly mean...What would Leila say if 
she found us?"

\medskip

"She would not mind acting, wouldn't she?

\medskip

"A brick would be a better choice as an actor in this situation."


Zhapur understood her cue as both of them undressed. Livia put her hair
in a ponytail before sitting on her knees. The physician lent 
her the aphrodisiac Leila showered with the nights they 
would do it. Facial expressions were key 
to this ploy's success. Livia had to stop herself from bursting into 
uncontrollable every time Zhapur moaned, the sound comparable to a snorting
boar. 


"Open the door!" screamed a man's voice.


The Men of The Crucible could not have come sooner. Livia heard 
boots stomping the garden as the Faithful ignored 
any rites of politeness. She breathed heavily before grabbing Zhapur's 
male organ. The first Man of the Crucible yelped, 
instantly covering his eyes 
upon coming into contact with the scene Livia and Zhapur presented them with. 
Zhapur leered at them 
with feigned outrage.


"I see some jealous men, milove..." cooed Livia.

"Please...Ah...Please... don't stop, love," said Zhapur. 
_Oh you are a good actor Zhapur._


"The Goddess be merciful! 
Fornicating pigs at a time like this? 
We are looking for the Empress, have you seen a woman wearing purple 
silk?" said the Man of the Crucible.

"Ooof, if only the Empress could also be here..." 

Livia shed crocodile tears. 
"Milord doesn't like me? 
Aren't these breasts worth your money? But I see milord's penis 
does looooove these hands."  

The two Men of the Crucible groaned in 
total revulsion. 
"Answer the Goddess damned question! 
Is the Empress here?"  

"What do you think simpletons? You can bring her here if you 
find her! I am sure she will enjoy me!"  

Livia whisked her finger, her lips imitating a fellatio. 
"If milords bring the Empress here, 
milords could be next...for the right amount of gold..." 

Livia blew them an insincere kiss causing both Men of The Crucible to contort 
in disdain.

"Slut! Cunt! 
Keep your filthy siphilis ridden hole for yourself!"" shouted one of them
before storming out of the clinic.


Zhapur and Livia stared at each other for at least three minutes before breaking 
eye contact. Both exploded in laughter once it became clear that the Men of the 
Crucible would not return.

"That was a most memorable performance. We put the court jesters 
at Persiphon to shame," said Zhapur as he dressed up.


Livia laid down on the carpet and giggled. It was true. She had never provided 
a performance as entertaining as this one. _Maybe I should have become 
an actress instead of an empress..._

"Ooooh, milove, we can always do it anytime when Leila is not around,"
Livia cackled with childish glee. Zhapur rolled his eyes at that suggestion.

"I am guessing, you will not explain how you managed to change your 
skin and your eyes?""

Livia paused. 
The intrusive thought of showing it all...Her days may be numbered so why not? 
The blood magic. If she 
exited Livia's body right here and right now? How would a non-Magi
react to all of it? No, how would a believer of the Firstborn make of it?
The Elysian had called the Magi Shaitan Pagestan: Demon Worshippers. If there was 
one thing the Faithful and the believers of the Firstborn could agree on was 
that the extermination of magic had been a necessity. Even a man as rational 
as Zhapur would not be able to withstand the ramifications of magic returning 
to the Known World. Deacons, oracles, sages, doctors, philosophers would commit 
suicide. The shock of being lied to for millenia. It would be too much to bear. 


"Would you believe me if I told you? The truth will make you 
an enemy of The Faith and of Claradore...


"I see...This path you have chosen...The path to a crown...
I have seen my own brother follow it..."


"You have never told me about that brother of yours. Who is he?"

"You wanted to know 
what I am called among Elysians, did you not?
Emperatori Neh Pargoz Nishodu is my nickname among my country men"

_You are my uncle?_ thought Livia.

"The Emperor Who Never Became. Why? Why let Nosrau take the throne?"

"My heart belongs with the patients. I could never dedicate myself to 
anything else asides tending to the sick."


"The ability to resist a crown. 
Not all men have the mental aptitude to do so.
Admirable."


"That is not what my own mother said when I had declined the throne. 
Insolent woman-child she had called me. I should have castrated you she had said. 
And she had wondered on her deathbed why I had never returned to Persiphon."

_What was it with Elysian royalty and disliking your own kin?_ thought Livia.

"Nix, are you not Elysian...Yet you are the Empress of the Medean 
Empire. An Elysian on a foreign throne...No...It can't be
The prophecy...No...Then that means..."

Liva cut him off. 
"The Faithful will head to the palace's gates...My brother will 
need me...You must leave the city this evening. A battle is to be fought soon. The Excubitores are too 
few in numbers to assist you should the need arise," said Livia.

"How? The Faith's monsters have blockaded all the gates"

"Use the city's sewers. 
The Red Guild can evacuate you, Leila and your daughter.

"What about you? Please, Nix, come with us. Noein is far from the 
clutches of those Faithful. You can work with me."

"I am sorry, one does not simply relinquish a throne..."

Zhapur's pained look jabbed her heart. When the last glimmers of sunlight had died out, 
Livia donned Leila's clothes. She hugged Zhapur. A hug that wanted 
to be reassuring through its torment. Why could she not guarantee his safety?
Is that how Baba felt on that day, not being able to protect her? 
_The True Goddess protect him and his family,_ thought Livia.

"Thank you again, doctor. May the True Goddess guide you 
to safety to Noein."

"May the Fistborn's Light guide you, Nix, my niece... Daughter of Nosrau...
Heiress to the Elysian Empire..."
