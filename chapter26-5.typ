The Cardinal Alexander stormed the court with his Magrub Dogas. Today was the day the Known World reckoned with the return of magic. Courtiers and noblewomen hid behind the columns. The Excubitores raised their lances in front of her throne, brown liquid leaking between their legs. The creatures howled, clawing at the pillars. They perched themselves atop chandeliers, drooling and hissing at any human below. Children screamed. Ralens the Younger went in front of her, brandishing his ceremonial dagger. Livia was unfazed by the historic event unfolding before her eyes. She was more perplexed about Alexander's decision to reveal the monsters to Thanatopolis' court. What did the Giant hope to achieve in bringing his collection of abominations?

Behind the Giant, Majorian sang a beastly song in the Forgotten Tongue. It spoke of a path of no return, a clash of ancient and current civilizations. 

Alexander made a solemn march towards her seat. He shoved asides any who dared to intrude in his path. A beautiful scar now ran from his forehead to his right cheek. 

"Where are the Magi?" he roared.

"Cardinal. This is sudden. You enter these halls with these...creations of yours. Are you one of those Magi of old? Is it fear you wish to instill on us? The non-Magi had feared magic once, but we can learn to challenge you Magi again. What are these other Magis you speak of? The only Magi I see is yourself," asked Livia.

"I do not have the time for philosophical ramblings, little girl. They hide in this city. I can sense them."

"The realm has not seen any Magi in a millennium. What do they resemble?"

"The Magi have returned! The-The-The Apocalypse! It is upon us!" yelled an aristocrat. He slit his throat with a dagger. A pandemic of terrorized faces spread through eunuchs, handmaidens and Excubitores alike. The last thing Livia wanted was for a stampede to erupt in the Palace Complex. The Magrub Dogas would revel in this opportunity to savor human guts. 

"Silence! I give you thirty days. You and your armies will scour this rat infested metropolis for those Magi. Once my terms have expired, the Magrub Dogas will put this city to the torch."

"Please, Cardinal, we truly do not comprehend what you are asking of us," pleaded Ralens the Younger. His legs trembled. A wetness ran on his legs.

"Do you believe a Magi fears you and your toy soldiers," said Alexander. He was wrong. Giants had never been considered Magis.

Alexander lifted Ralens the Younger's head with his palm. The Emperor yelped, flailing his legs in the air. Livia had to think fast.

"We acquiesce your demands, Cardinal. The Magi will be found. Please provide means to identify them."

"Magrub Dogas will assist your search. They can smell Magi from two miles away," said Alexander.

This conundrum gave Livia a migraine. Despite wielding the Forge and its Magrub Dogas, the Faith resorted to sheer brutality to achieve its maximalist objective of annihilating the Magi. What was there to fear on their end? The Goddess was dead. Claradore no longer possessed a noteworthy physical body. As for Nix, she would be enjoying Livia's hospitality indefinitely. Any rational being would have declared victory. The Faith had won. It was plain and simple. Why not savor the victory?

The blood leaking from the noble who slit his throat brought her back to the throne room.

Alexander turned his back on her. He gestured for the Magrub Dogas to leave the premises. They shrieked and wailed unholy growls before landing on the red carpet and escorting their master to the outside. A suffocating silence gripped the Medean court. Like a play that had broken the fourth dimension, the audience stood aghast awaiting the comedians and performers. There was no protocol, no contingency for this situation.

Ralens the Younger seized her shoulders. "Sister, what is to be done? Have the Magi truly returned? Wh-what about those creatures? How do we slay them?"

The fact that he desired to destroy the Magrub Dogas was a good starting point. 

She brushed his cheeks. "Be calm, brother. Panic only serves our enemy. As incredulous as those monsters are, they reveal crucial information. The Faith were hiding these creatures from the Known World for decades. Why showcase their greatest weapon, now? The answer is simple. They are weak."

"How is this weakness sister? Any men would tremble in fear before a Magrub Doga."

"Have you not listened?  If the Faith is willing to reveal their most valuable assets, it is because they fear something? What are those Magis the Cardinal refer to? The Faith desire our collaboration in their search through coercion. But what if we were to seize the Magi before the Faith? Grimoires, spells, recipes for potions could be extracted from them. The non-Magi had pried the secrets out of the Magi through enhanced interrogation techniques. Surely, we can recreate their success."

"And what should happen if those fiends are unleashed on our citizens?"

Then we should answer with our own secrets. Men do fear Magrub Doga but fire, Medean Fire does not."

From the balcony, she could see Alexander's chariot conducting laps on the capital's streets. A disfigured corpse was attached to the back of the carriage It was Serena's corpse. The court watched the morbid procession run its course through the city. The words MAGI were carved on Serena's scalp. Every lap brought more bruises on Serena's battered body. Bones and tendons were revealed.

Majorian stood atop an obelisk, deploying their black wings. They sang a song about relentless despair. Men and women teared up. How they wept upon hearing Majorian's majestic voice? The bards and storytellers would tell the tale of the demonic messiah of music, the one who sang of the Magi's return. Who could not convince them that Apocalypse did not draw near? Livia allowed herself to cry upon gazing at Serena's corpse. 

Superstition was a habit that could not be broken easily. Men and women chose their religion, entrenching themselves in their faith until they passed through the Gates of the Underworld. This was the principal reason for the Faith's success on the masses. The populace never questioned the Goddess for she was truth incarnate. The Goddess' name could command one to slit their own throat before an enemy. It could command one to burn a witch's house in front of an innocent child. It could command one to start crusades against perceived heretics. With the rumors of the Apocalypse's coming now let loose on the Known World, there was confusion and fear to be harnessed. How? Livia would spend the entirety of her bath pondering.

Tonight, the denizens of Thanatopolis would pray to the Goddess for deliverance against the Magi. If they had known that the corpse Alexander dragged behind his chariot belonged to the Goddess, the entire would be committing mass suicide.
