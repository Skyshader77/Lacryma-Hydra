The Cardinal Alexander stormed the court with his Magrub Dogas. Today was the day the Known World reckoned with the return of magic. Courtiers and noblewomen hid behind the columns. The Excubitores raised their lances in front of her throne, brown liquid leaking between their legs. The creatures howled, clawing at the pillars. They perched themselves atop chandeliers, drooling and hissing at any human below. Children screamed. Ralens the Younger hid behind her. Livia was unfazed by the historic event unfolding before her eyes. She was more perplexed about Alexander's decision to reveal the monsters to Thanatopolis' court. What did the Giant hope to achieve in bringing his collection of abominations?

Behind the Giant, Majorian sang a beastly song in the Forgotten Tongue. It spoke of a path of no return, a clash of ancient and current civilizations. 

Alexander made a solemn march towards her seat. He shoved asides any who dared to intrude in his path. A beautiful scar now ran from his forehead to his right cheek. 

"Where are the Magi?" he roared.

"Cardinal. You enter these halls with these...creations of yours. Are you one of those Magi of old? Is it fear you wish to instill on us? The non-Magi had feared magic once, but we can learn to challenge you Magi again. What are these other Magis you speak of? The only Magi I see is yourself," asked Livia.

"I do not have the time for philosophical ramblings, little girl. They hide in this city. I can sense them."

"The realm has not seen any Magi in a millennium. What do they look like?"

"The Magi have returned! The-The-The Apocalypse! It is upon us!" yelled an aristocrat. He slit his throat with a dagger. A pandemic of terrorized faces spread through eunuchs, handmaidens and Excubitores alike. The last thing Livia was for a stampede to erupt in the Palace Complex. The Magrub Dogas would revel in this opportunity to savor human guts. 

"Silence! I give you thirty days. You and your armies will scour this rat infested metropolis for those Magi. Once my generous terms have expired, the Magrub Dogas will put this city to the torch."

"Please, Cardinal, we truly do not comprehend what you are asking of us," pleaded Ralens the Younger.

Ralens the Younger seized her shoulders. "Sister, what is to be done? Have the Magi truly returned?"

She brushed his cheeks. "Be calm, brother. Panic only serves our enemy. As incredulous as those monsters are, they reveal crucial information. The Faith were hiding these creatures from the Known World for decades. Why showcase their greatest weapon, now? The answer is simple. They are weak."

"How is this weakness sister? Any men would tremble in fear before a Magrub Doga."

"Have you not listened?  If the Faith is willing to reveal their most valuable assets, it is because they fear something? What are those Magis the Cardinal refer to? The Faith desire our collaboration in their search through coercion. But what if we were to seize the Magi before the Faith? Grimoires, spells, recipes for potions could be extracted from them. The non-Magi had pried the secrets out of the Magi through enhanced interrogation techniques. Surely, we can recreate their success."

"And what should happen if those fiends are unleashed on our citizens?"

Then we should answer with our own secrets. Men do fear Magrub Doga but fire, Medean Fire does not."

From the balcony, she could see Alexander's chariot conducting laps on the capital's streets. A disfigured corpse was attached to the back of the carriage It was Serena's corpse. The court watched the morbid procession run its course through the city. The words MAGI were carved on Serena's scalp. Tonight, the denizens of Thanatopolis would pray to the Goddess for deliverance against the Magi. If they had known the corpse belonged to the Goddess, the entire would be committing mass suicide.
