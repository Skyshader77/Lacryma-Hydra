Nix sashayed through the Elysians that had gathered at Kornicus' Palace.
For tonight, she chose to pleasure Majorian with Livia's dress, delighting in 
Livia's musk and perfume which still clung to the attire. To complement 
her noblewoman disguise, she borrowed purple diamonds from the princess' collection
and braided her locks in the same manner as Medean royalty.
The Elysians had to see 
her as a patrician. Power rested where people believed it to be. 
For this one night, she would receive the adulation of a lifetime. 

While cloaked in purple, all of the attendants greeted her with bows
as she made her way through the arches and colonnaded corridors. Handmaidens and slaves queried her for citrus drinks and exquisite wine from the Vyrmogothian Kingdom. 

The late Emperor Kornicus chose this residence to retire. He was one of the few 
Sarvitarian Emperors to have died in his sleep. How someone decided to live the rest of his life cultivating onions and cabbage instead of sitting on a throne 
was beyond Nix' comprehension. His Palace was as immense as a small town, even at some point possessing its own garrison. 

Sphinxes from Noein met her at the entrance of the peristyle. Elysians chatted about the new Medean Emperor as they walked through the gardens animated by 
statues of Kornicus and his late wife. In the corners, Nix saw Serena engage four 
Elysians in what appeared to be a drinking contest. Six flasks of alcohol sat emptied next to Serena's lap. Her competitors were groaning on the floor. Nix 
slowly advanced towards her friend, avoiding men who wanted to start a conversation on politics and religious affairs.

"Nobody has ever defeated the great Serena in a battle of liquor," spoke Serena in the Imperial Tongue.

"Serena, what brings you here?" asked Nix.

Serena gestured to the vanquished's purses and wallets. 
Nix rolled her eyes.

"You cannot blame me, Phoenix Wing. This is the prime opportunity to enrich ourselves. Did you know the princess Zahna will be here?"

"Claradore has told me."

"They say the Emperor of Kings wishes to wed her to the Medean Emperor."

The thought of Ralens being married made Nix chuckle. No formal toga nor tunic could hide the Emperor's boyish cheeks. Any would-be bride would not be able to resist the temptation of squeezing those round and fat cheeks.

"Claradore has the final say on that," said Nix.

"Really? I would think getting a foothold on the Elysian throne would please him."

"The Rauthengardian Throne has more value."

"Interesting, but Princess Amali is already wed to Gildahad."

"She will bear him a daughter."

Serena stifled a laugh. "Men...Always ordering brides like at a food stand. 
What about you, Phoenix Wing? Do you have a prince in mind? What about this Majorian fellow?"

"I am not sure anyone would call them a prince."

A mellowing voice coursed through the Palace's hallways. Nix let herself be rocked by the melody which sang poetry in the Classical Tongue. It was Majorian.
Their voice guided her through 
the guests. She found herself in the Vestibule. Guests and reliefs 
portraying Kornicus' campaigns against the Rauthengardians surrounded the sunshine 
of her days. Interestingly enough, 
Majorian chose to use a woman's voice for this occasion. 

They were endowed in a rose tunic, probably acquired from the Rauthengardian Kingdom. Painted nails and powdered cheeks enhanced the appearance of a 
refined lady. A kaleidoscope of aphrodisiac vanilla with top notes of lemon and violet leaves swirled around Nix's nose.

Their fingers played a harp. Vocal octaves glided down the strings,
enchanting men and women alike. Nix caught their eye, almost causing them to 
stop their music. She took the opportunity to rotate her hips and shoulders, 
flaunting the purple dress.

"Are you to be wed to the Emperor of Kings, my Lady,"
asked Majorian with their female voice.

"And be relayed to the shadows of his harem? No, thank you," said Nix.

"Careful with your tongue, the princess Zahna lurks around. You should see her 
turquoise robe. The silk must come from the Unknown World."

Butterflies flew in Nix's stomach. She had to resist the temptation of kissing 
Majorian on the lips. She settled instead for their cheeks. The Elysians abhorred behaviors they deemed to be unnatural. Nix did not fancy getting stoned by a mob while wearing the finest 
purple dress she could get her hands on.

Nix felt a woman's arm on her shoulder. "Look at you two, swans gracing the lake 
with majesty. How are you not the stars of this galaxy? 
Come, we need liquor and men to dance with," said Serena in the Imperial Tongue. Her breath stank of wine and pomegranate.

"You are in no position to dance," laughed Nix.

"No, no, no, I sure am not, 
but I have heard someone here must learn who Empress Aishula was."

"She has been dead these twenty summers. You might as well search for a single grain of sand in the Elysian deserts."

"I would not be so sure, Phoenix Wing."

"What are you insinuating?"

Serena did not answer. Instead, she grabbed Majorian's hand and made a dash 
for the liquor stand. Nix sighed for she would be carrying Serena's inebriated 
body back to the tavern. Maybe tonight was reason to celebrate. Her ploy with the 
Men of the Crucible bore fruit. Around fifty of them fell ill in the aftermath of 
her pouring her concoction into their drinking water. Nix even assisted Zhapur 
in nursing a handful of them to good health. The less unfortunate however, 
were left devoid of their eyesight...permanently.

She did not have to wait for the Man in White's next move. The foolish zealots 
simply assumed their fountain was cursed. The Emperor granted them a lodge in 
the Palace Complex, not knowing his new guests' lives now hung by a thread. 
Nix would now decide when and how the Man in White's life would be forfeited. 

She wandered the halls of the Villa contemplating frescoes of Kornicus hunting wild boars with his sons who ignited bountiful of civil wars after his death.
She probed Elysians for the name Aishula only to receive incoherent sentences 
and drunken japes as answers. It had seemed the memory of the disgraced Empress
has either disappeared or did not want to resurface in the modern era. When she tired of querying Elysians, Nix returned to the Vestibule to lounge on a chair.
A marble statue depicting Kornicus in a state of intense meditation stood in the corner. Perhaps she was asking the Goddess why she has given him two stupid sons?

"Aishula?" asked a woman's voice.

Nix turned her head. A lady cased in a sapphire tunic with prancing gryphons
and surging peacocks had appeared. A purple shawl gilded with dark blue diamonds enveloped her neck. Her tongue was eloquent, even aristocratic. Five Elysian men
in plain clothes flanked her. Nix deduced that they were Vodrath Anshar, the personal retinue of the Emperor of Kings and his elite bodyguards.
Nix had no doubt that this was the princess Zahna that Majorian spoke about.

"You must have mistaken me for someone else," said Nix in the Elysian Tongue.
The Elysian men muffled a laugh upon hearing her accent.

"My apologies. You are but her reflection given flesh," said Zahna.

"I have never been mistaken for royalty, my Lady,"

"Your accent...You were raised among the Medeans, were you not? You must have never 
seen Persiphon's splendour. What a tragedy."

"Lord Claradore proved an excellent teacher."

"Funny, he speaks with an accent no one in the Known World can produce."

"My lady, her eyes! Her eyes! Don't you see? They are his!" hissed one of the Elysian Vodrath Anshar.

"A mere coincidence it is, Nader." Nix tried to see through the mask that Zahna wore. The Elysian princess' lips were crisped, her green eyes spat bewilderment, the hallmarks of a lie. Nix was thankful that the Elysians would never break the 
rules of hospitality.

"But what if is not?" said Nader.

A silence as heavy as a lance fell between them. The Elysian princess scrutinized Nix's eyes. If Zahna gave any order to her men, Nix would respond with her concealed dagger.

"The Empress Aishula has already paid for her sins against my father. We have both seen her severed head multiple times. Unless you believe this girl is a revenant..." said Zahna.

Nix touched her hands and pinched her skin.
"I have never heard of revenants who can pinch their skin, my Lady," said Nix.
Zahna snorted.

"The Outer Provinces tell of basilisks in their midst. A revenant is no greater madness," said the Vodrath Anshar.

"So we speak about basilisks and revenants now? Those do not exist anymore, 
my Lady."

"You are wrong...Forgive my manners, your name still eludes me," said Zahna.

"People call me Nix."

"Fascinating. Does the name Roxanna mean anything to you?"

"Roxanna?"

"It is the name of the late Aishula's daughter."

"A traitorous girl who escaped death," said a Vodrath Anshar. Nix gazed at their hidden blades, all 
bulkier than hers.

"Forgive my men's bluntness. The scars from twenty years ago still linger in their minds."

"Forgive my ignorance. I was born and raised in the Medean Empire. What sins did she commit, my Lady?" asked Nix.

"That wretched girl... I remember the wedding all too well. Her own parents had gifted her to my father for gold. At court, she had the misfortune of stirring my late mother's jealousy. My father, the Emperor of Kings, had both Aishula and her babe put to deathâ€”but not before the girl cursed him: My child shall mount your head upon a pyre that burns for a hundred years."

"Does that curse still haunt the Emperor of Kings? The babe and the mother are dead."

"The mother, yes but the child...The child was spirited away before she could be sent to the Gates of the Underworld. Some say the child did not live to see 
her majority. Others do not share that sentiment...Some even think that she stands right before me."

Nix clenched her hidden dagger. The Vodrath Anshar leered at her. Those lunatics!
She could not be the child of a dead woman. Claradore would have told her. Claradore would have known. Why did her physical resemblance with the Empress Aishula unnerve those Elysians? 

Never had she turned away as quickly from a conversation as she did. 
Her sprinting legs brought her to Majorian and Serena who were enjoying 
Elysian juice in the peristyle.

"We leave now," said Nix.

Both of her allies were dumbfounded. 

"Is something the matter?" asked Majorian. Nix's eyes gave them the answer they needed. They scurried down the colonnaded hallways past the marble statues of Kornicus and his heirs. They walked slowly not disturbing the chatter of the Elysians. Nix was aware that from the moment the rules of hospitality would no longer apply, the Vodrath Anshar will be stalking her like a gryphon hunts 
larks in the sky.

They found themselves on the road. Rain drizzled on the old Sarvitarian concrete ridden with potholes. 

"Have you angered an Elysian princess by chance, Phoenix Wing?" asked Serena.

"Worse. She believes me to be Aishula's daughter, the subject of an absurd prophecy."

"The Elysians wage war over prophecies. I have sung a few of their epics. 
The quality of their poetry is unmatched,"
said Majorian.

"This is no time to be praising our would-be assassins!" said Nix.

"Hoh! So she even intends to murder you, now. Your list of admirers grows larger 
by the day."

"This is no laughing matter. We must inform Claradore. The Princess of Kings 
wants me dead."

"Phoenix Wing, as much as I find your story amusing, nobility has little time to decide the fate of one commoner.
Surely she was exchanging pleasantries."

"The Vodrath Anshar disagree with you, Serena. They will be upon us."

"Will you use magic?"

Nix grinned. "Why else would we be alone at this very moment?"

An earthquake of hooves echoed through the pouring rain.
Nix looked behind her. Hooded riders rode to meet them, their lances and swords 
glistening under the growling thunder. Nix was no desperate fool. There was no outrunning horses. Moreover, it was she who 
the Elysians wanted. Having Majorian in her proximity would leave her adversaries 
the possibility of using them as a hostage. 

"Run!" Nix said to her two allies. "I will be joining you two soon."

Serena and Majorian ran for the tavern four imperial miles from their current location. 

A strident shriek peeled through the storm. The horses neighed violently,
almost expelling their riders from the saddle as they stopped.
No animal in the Known World could produce that sound. Nix's blood froze. 
Pairs of wings emerged from the night. The things that were headed her way 
were a cross between a bat and a lizard. No, every one of them was a perfidious 
mockery of the animal kingdom as if a wizard has chosen to randomize every animal parts into a single vessel. 
Yet their arms were distinctly human. Scythes, lances and pitchforks gleaned 
alongside their teeth.

Nix did not know which event was more implausible: the fact that she could have a claim to the Elysian throne or that Margrub Dogas, the chimeras of the past, had returned. The dire news in all of this was that the Red Guild did not possess the capability to produce Margrub Dogas. Claradore had told her they needed another three years to be able to 
create those weapons from human bodies.

A skin-pimpling chill ran down Nix's spine. Then who in the Known World could 
create Margrub Dogas if not the Red Guild. She was curious. Were the creatures 
as ferocious and craven as the legends portrayed them? 

Her Elysians lacked her curiosity. Her pursuers wasted no minute and turned their tail. The Magrub Dogas
nosedived towards the men, impaling horse and man with their talons and claws. 
Elysians flailed their lances and swords to no avail.
Guts were spilled, arms and heads were ripped apart with bestial savagery. 

Nix melted her right arm into a blood blade. If the monsters were not the Red Guild's then surely she would have to face them. She glanced at Livia's tattered 
dress. _All good things must come to and end,_ thought Nix.

The Margrub Dogas did not consume their victims, confirming that it was 
indeed humans who gave birth to them. The chimeras circled above her. They howled. There were four beasts.

The first monster fell from the sky, bearing down its claws. 
She parried it. Nix recognized the nauseating scent of the Underworld, this mix of sulfur 
and urine. Her left arm seized its throat, her nails and fingers 
digging into its scaled flesh. The texture was akin to a crocodile's skin.
The thing roared in agony as her fingers found its arteries. Shaping them into scissors, she snipped and snipped. Blood gushed from the creature as it collapsed on the 
paved road, disintegrating into a puddle of black ashes.

_Those things were once human,_ thought Nix.

The second and third creatures seemed to have been blessed with a brain for 
they attacked simultaneously. Nix did not care. She closed her eyes. Wings sprouted from her back, further tearing her 
once beautiful attire. Rain cascaded down her arms and legs as she jumped to 
avoid their coordinated assault. She took a deep breath. Her entire torso liquified, followed by her head, shedding Livia's dress. Her liquid form 
rushed towards the second monster, seeping through its ears, jaws and nose. 
She soon felt its once human arms, its heavy wings and its teeth as sharp as a shark. Its strength and agility were hers to command. Yet, there was unease 
in this body. It was the same sensation that she had encountered when entering Livia's flesh. _No, it cannot be,_ thought Nix.


She did not have the ponder to ponder on the Margrub Dogas' origins. Her third opponent visibly did not care about the 
well-being of its ally as it lunged at her with its serrated teeth. 
With her new 
claws, she slashed, cleaving her enemy's rib cage. The chimera roared in pain.
One by one, her borrowed assets
picked rib after rib out of the opposing Margrub Doga 
until no life was left in 
its beastly eyes. Her blood then accumulated within the second Margrub Doga's head. She felt herself burst out of its skull, reconstituting herself under the 
storm.

The last chimera leered at her with anticipation. Nix motioned for it to try its 
chance against her with her index finger.

Instead, the fourth creature chose the wisest and the most dangerous option. It flew overhead making a beeline for Serena and Majorian. Nix uttered a litany of 
profanities. More inhuman howls erupted through the night. They organized themselves into an insidious orchestra as if heralding her impending doom. 
Dozens more monsters entertained the concert in the sky above. _What in the Underworld is happening?_ 
thought Nix. Was the world about to end? 
There has never been so many fell beasts since the Age of Magic. She dedcued that someone had a Forge to create them. And only a Magi could 
operate the contraption.

_So there is another Magi asides me and Claradore,_ thought Nix.

Nix bolted under the torrential rain. Why were these creatures targeting her? 
The likely answer was that they knew she was a Magi. Yet only Serena, Majorian and Claradore were aware of that fact. A traitor? She would have to ascertain 
that after she has dealt with the chimeras. But were it to be true, her life may already been forfeited. 

Her feet ached as she stepped on mud and rock. The cold sharpened around her, 
grating her skin. Endless darkness paraded in front of her, eternalizing the 
distance between her and her allies. Even if she could reach them, how will she fend off the horde of fiends that this new enemy has conjured? Only now did she realize her first victims used her as their plaything. She was an idiot. Nix had let them gauge her, a terrible mistake. 

A shrill scream rang through the frosty air. Serena's voice. Nix hurried, 
now feeling her lungs sear in pain. She no longer felt her legs. _Please be safe,
_ thought Nix. It was a naive thought she admitted. What could Serena and Majorian
do against that army? Nix's eyes swelled with tears. She had failed Baba and 
let herself be weak. If she got beaten again, Claradore would never look at her in the eye again.

Claradore's words resonated in her head. _Baba had let herself be weak and the weak...The weak get beaten_

Nix saw Serena's tunic hang from a torn fence post. Finally, she was close.
Her skin shivered. The fabric was soaked in blood. The trail led to Serena 
who was reclining against an uprooted tree. A creature's severed talon was 
embedded in her right leg. 

"Phoenix...Wing...I'm sorry..." said Serena. Nix did not like that statement.

"Where...Where is Majorian?" said Nix.

"There...are...too...many...Alexander...Need...to...kill..."

"I do not understand. Where is Majorian?"

Serena pointed to the black sky. A drop of blood landed on Nix's forehead. 
Then another. Nix screeched. She forced her eyes to look up. A ring of fiends flew above forming a procession straight from the Gates of the Underworld. 
They circled around four of their own. The beasts chanted monstrous cants by using a parody of human speech. Majorian's legless body was carried by the four Magrub Dogas.
