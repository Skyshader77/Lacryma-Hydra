Nix sashayed through the Elysians that had gathered at Kornicus' Palace.
For tonight, she chose to pleasure Majorian with Livia's dress, delighting in 
Livia's musk and perfume which still clung to the attire. To complement 
her noblewoman disguise, she borrowed purple diamonds from the princess' collection
and braided her locks in the same manner as Medean royalty.
The Elysians had to see 
her as a patrician. Power rested where people believed it to be. 
For this one night, she would receive the adulation of a lifetime. 

While cloaked in purple, all of the attendants greeted her with bows
as she made her way through the arches and colonnaded corridors. Handmaidens and slaves queried her for citrus drinks and exquisite wine from the Vyrmogothian Kingdom. 

The late Emperor Kornicus chose this residence to retire. He was one of the few 
Sarvitarian Emperors to have died in his sleep. How someone decided to live the rest of his life cultivating onions and cabbage instead of sitting on a throne 
was beyond Nix' comprehension. His Palace was as immense as a small town, even at some point possessing its own garrison. 

Sphinxes from Noein met her at the entrance of the peristyle. Elysians chatted about the new Medean Emperor as they walked through the gardens animated by 
statues of Kornicus and his late wife. In the corners, Nix saw Serena engage four 
Elysians in what appeared to be a drinking contest. Six flasks of alcohol sat emptied next to Serena's lap. Her competitors were groaning on the floor. Nix 
slowly advanced towards her friend, avoiding men who wanted to start a conversation on politics and religious affairs.

"Nobody has ever defeated the great Serena in a battle of liquor," spoke Serena in the Imperial Tongue.

"Serena, what brings you here?" asked Nix.

Serena gestured to the vanquished's purses and wallets. 
Nix rolled her eyes.

"You cannot blame me, Phoenix Wing. This is the prime opportunity to enrich ourselves. Did you know the princess Zahna will be here?"

"Claradore has told me."

"They say the Emperor of Kings wishes to wed her to the Medean Emperor."

The thought of Ralens being married made Nix chuckle. No formal toga nor tunic could hide the Emperor's boyish cheeks. Any would-be bride would not be able to resist the temptation of squeezing those round and fat cheeks.

"Claradore has the final say on that," said Nix.

"Really? I would think getting a foothold on the Elysian throne would please him."

"The Rauthengardian Throne has more value."

"Interesting, but Princess Amali is already wed to Gildahad."

"She will bear him a daughter."

Serena stifled a laugh. "Men...Always ordering brides like at a food stand. 
What about you, Phoenix Wing? Do you have a prince in mind? What about this Majorian fellow?"

"I am not sure anyone would call them a prince."

A mellowing voice coursed through the Palace's hallways. Nix let herself be rocked by the melody which sang poetry in the Classical Tongue. It was Majorian.
Their voice guided her through 
the guests. She found herself in a vestibule. Guests surrounded the sunshine 
of her days. Interestingly enough, 
Majorian chose to use a woman's voice for this occasion. 

They were endowed in a rose tunic, probably acquired from the Rauthengardian Kingdom. Painted nails and powdered cheeks enhanced the appearance of a 
refined lady. A kaleidoscope of aphrodisiac vanilla with top notes of lemon and violet leaves swirled around Nix's nose.

Their fingers played a harp. Vocal octaves glided down the strings,
enchanting men and women alike. Nix caught their eye, almost causing them to 
stop their music. She took the opportunity to rotate her hips and shoulders, 
flaunting the purple dress.

"Aishula?" asked the woman cased in a sapphire tunic with prancing gryphons
and surging peacocks. Her tongue was eloquent, even aristocratic. Five Elysian men
in plain clothes flanked her. It must be the princess Zahna Majorian spoke about.

"You must have mistaken me for someone else," said Nix in the Elysian Tongue.

"My apologies. You are but her doppelganger," said Zahna.

"I have never been mistaken for royalty, my Lady,"

"Your accent...You were raised by Medeans, were you not?"

"Lord Claradore is an excellent teacher."

"Funny, he speaks with an accent no one in the Known World can produce."

"My Lady, her eyes! Her eyes! They're his!" whispered one of the Elysian men.

"A mere coincidence it is, Nader."

"But what if?"

"The Empress Aishula has already paid for her sins against my father. We have both seen her head. Unless you believe this girl is a revenant..."

"The Outer Provinces speak of encountering basilisks. A revenant is not far fetched."

"Forgive my men. The scars from twenty years ago still linger in their minds."

"Forgive my ignorance. I was born and raised in the Medean Empire. What sins did she commit, my Lady?" asked Nix.

"That dreadful girl...She has had the misfortune of provoking the jealousy of my late mother. My father, the Emperor of Kings, had both Aishula and the babe killed but not before the wicked Aishula 
had the time to curse him: my child will raise your head upon a centennial blaze."
