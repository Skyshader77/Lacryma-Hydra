Nix sashayed through the Elysians that had gathered at Kornicus' Palace.
For tonight, she chose to pleasure Majorian with Livia's dress, delighting in 
Livia's musk and perfume which still clung to the attire. To complement 
her noblewoman disguise, she borrowed purple diamonds from the princess' collection
and braided her locks in the same manner as Medean royalty.
The Elysians had to see 
her as a patrician. Power rested where people believed it to be. 
For this one night, she would receive the adulation of a lifetime. 

While cloaked in purple, all of the attendants greeted her with bows
as she made her way through the arches and colonnaded corridors. Handmaidens and slaves queried her for citrus drinks and exquisite wine from the Vyrmogothian Kingdom. 

The late Emperor Kornicus chose this residence to retire. He was one of the few 
Sarvitarian Emperors to have died in his sleep. How someone decided to live the rest of his life cultivating onions and cabbage instead of sitting on a throne 
was beyond Nix' comprehension. His Palace was as immense as a small town, even at some point possessing its own garrison. 

Sphinxes from Noein met her at the entrance of the peristyle. Elysians chatted about the new Medean Emperor as they walked through the gardens animated by 
statues of Kornicus and his late wife. In the corners, Nix saw Serena engage four 
Elysians in what appeared to be a drinking contest. Six flasks of alcohol sat emptied next to Serena's lap. Her competitors were groaning on the floor. Nix 
slowly advanced towards her friend, avoiding men who wanted to start a conversation on politics and religious affairs.

"Nobody has ever defeated the great Serena in a battle of liquor," spoke Serena in the Imperial Tongue.

"Serena, what brings you here?" asked Nix.

Serena gestured to the vanquished's purses and wallets. 
Nix rolled her eyes.

"You cannot blame me, Phoenix Wing. This is the prime opportunity to enrich ourselves. Did you know the princess Zahna will be here?"

"Claradore has told me."

"They say the Emperor of Kings wishes to wed her to the Medean Emperor."

The thought of Ralens being married made Nix chuckle. No formal toga nor tunic could hide the Emperor's boyish cheeks. Any would-be bride would not be able to resist the temptation of squeezing those round and fat cheeks.

"Claradore has the final say on that," said Nix.

"Really? I would think getting a foothold on the Elysian throne would please him."

"The Rauthengardian Throne has more value."

"Interesting, but Princess Amali is already wed to Gildahad."

"She will bear him a daughter."

Serena stifled a laugh. "Men...Always ordering brides like at a food stand. 
What about you, Phoenix Wing? Do you have a prince in mind? What about this Majorian fellow?"

"I am not sure anyone would call them a prince."

A mellowing voice coursed through the Palace's hallways. Nix let herself be rocked by the melody which sang poetry in the Classical Tongue. It was Majorian.
Their voice guided her through 
the guests. She found herself in a vestibule. Guests surrounded the sunshine 
of her days. Interestingly enough, 
Majorian chose to use a woman's voice for this occasion. 

They were endowed in a rose tunic, probably acquired from the Rauthengardian Kingdom. Painted nails and powdered cheeks enhanced the appearance of a 
refined lady. A kaleidoscope of aphrodisiac vanilla with top notes of lemon and violet leaves swirled around Nix's nose.

Their fingers played a harp. Vocal octaves glided down the strings,
enchanting men and women alike. Nix caught their eye, almost causing them to 
stop their music. She took the opportunity to rotate her hips and shoulders, 
flaunting the purple dress.

"Are you to be wed to the Emperor of Kings, my Lady,"
asked Majorian with their female voice.

"And be relayed to the shadows of his harem? No, thank you," said Nix.

"Careful with your tongue, the princess Zahna lurks around. You should see her 
turquoise robe. The silk must come from the Unknown World."

Butterflies flew in Nix's stomach. She had to resist the temptation of kissing 
Majorian on the lips. She settled instead for their cheeks. The Elysians abhorred behaviors they deemed to be unnatural. Nix did not fancy getting stoned by a mob while wearing the finest 
purple dress she could get her hands on.

Nix felt a woman's arm on her shoulder. "Look at you two, swans gracing the lake 
with majesty. We need liquor and men to dance with," said Serena in the Imperial Tongue. Her breath stank of wine and pomegranate.

"You are in no position to dance," laughed Nix.

"No, no, no, I sure am not, 
but I have heard someone here must learn who Empress Aishula was."

"She has been dead these twenty summers. You might as well search for a single grain of sand in the Elysian deserts."

"I would not be so sure, Phoenix Wing."

"What are you insinuating?"

Serena did not answer. Instead, she grabbed Majorian's hand and made a dash 
for the liquor stand. Nix sighed for she would be carrying Serena's inebriated 
body back to the tavern. Maybe tonight was reason to celebrate. Her ploy with the 
Men of the Crucible bore fruit. Around fifty of them fell ill in the aftermath of 
her pouring her concoction into their drinking water. Nix even assisted Zhapur 
in nursing a handful of them to good health. The less unfortunate however, 
were left devoid of their eyesight...permanently.

She did not have to wait for the Man in White's next move. The foolish zealots 
simply assumed their fountain was cursed. The Emperor granted them a lodge in 
the Palace Complex, not knowing his new guests' lives now hung by a thread. 
Nix would now decide when and how the Man in White's life would be forfeited. 

"Aishula?" asked the woman cased in a sapphire tunic with prancing gryphons
and surging peacocks. Her tongue was eloquent, even aristocratic. Five Elysian men
in plain clothes flanked her. It must be the princess Zahna Majorian spoke about.

"You must have mistaken me for someone else," said Nix in the Elysian Tongue.

"My apologies. You are but her reflection given flesh," said Zahna.

"I have never been mistaken for royalty, my Lady,"

"Your accent...You were raised among the Medeans, were you not? You have never 
seen Persiphon's splendour. What a tragedy."

"Lord Claradore proved an excellent teacher."

"Funny, he speaks with an accent no one in the Known World can produce."

"My lady, her eyes! Her eyes! Don't you see? They are his!" hissed one of the Elysian men.

"A mere coincidence it is, Nader."

"But what if is not?"

"The Empress Aishula has already paid for her sins against my father. We have both seen her severed head multiple times. Unless you believe this girl is a revenant..."

"The Outer Provinces tell of basilisks in their midst. A revenant is no greater madness."

"Forgive my men. The scars from twenty years ago still linger in their minds."

"Forgive my ignorance. I was born and raised in the Medean Empire. What sins did she commit, my Lady?" asked Nix.

"That wretched girl... I remember the wedding all too well. Her own parents had gifted her to my father for gold. At court, she had the misfortune of stirring my late mother's jealousy. My father, the Emperor of Kings, had both Aishula and her babe put to deathâ€”but not before the girl cursed him: My child shall mount your head upon a pyre that burns for a hundred years."
