They smelled Thanatopolis before seeing it. It was logical that a metropolis that immense would sense their presence first and not the other way around. Miroconium had been characterized by the cow and horse manure whose odor would float by Baba’s house during summer days. In Thanatopolis’ case, she noticed one thing: chimneys. A lot of them. It had seemed the population’s entire supper flew in the air, the scent of tons of spices and oils coalescing with salt. Nix’ encyclopedias had told her that the city bore 300 000 inhabitants by the start of the previous century. Ordogan had corrected her: 500 000 souls now lived in it.

#emph[500 000! 500 times more than Miroconium!] How would all of them fit into the same space as Miroconium? She realized this was a stupid question once they reached Vitiatus’ Mount overlooking the peninsula. If a human’s jaw had any flexibility, hers must had reached its limit once Thanatopolis unraveled before her. #emph[Oh Baba!]

The artist had done a superb job at illustrating the imperial capital but no image could ever suffice to make a child comprehend the scale and size of the settlement. The aqueduct of Charov, glued in the corner of the page of her book, was actually this enormous brick serpent traversing the entirety of the city, streching beyond Vitiatus’ Mount. It ondulated making arches across rivers and the fortifications. To think humans could build such artificial snakes. She stood next to one its pillars, her mouth agape. A single of its supports was thrice as tall as Baba’s home, some delinquants having drawn graffiti of lower parts only men had. #emph[Idiots.]

Past the Marroan Walls, which she could see from at least fifteen kilometers away, was this entity that she only knew through literature. It separated continents, a mass of water, home to various animals she had seldom seen in fishmarkets. Only when one was next to it, the waves caressing one’s feet that one truly grasped how insignificant one was in their existence. For this seemingly endless body of fluid extended far beyond the horizon. So many of her books had theorized of laid beyond the boundaries of the Known World. From gigantic waterfalls leading to a starless void to an undiscovered continent to the spiritual realm that birthed the Goddess, no human, not even Baba had the answer to that.

And of course, Emperor Vitiatus had his capital built next to this entity. The Palace Complex she had heard multiple things about laid before her pupils, its five domes she wanted to replicate in her sketchbook. Right now, its white marble shone next to the glittering water, casting the illusion of a swan deploying its wings, a crown of gold reminding of all other beings of its magnificence. If only Nix still had that book. She had known the building as an ugly duckling, a mere almagalm of stones and bricks when it had hatched on the shores. #emph[So that is where all the fairy tales got their inspiration for their castles...]

Claradore put a hand on her shoulder. She smiled back at him. He pointed to the Marroans Walls. Baba had told her the tale of the Molochian Emperor Ultzindur who turned away with his tail between his legs at the sight of the battlements. Nix looked over to her Molochian companions. Instead of fearing the walls as she thought they would, they were playing dice with Ordogan, with pepper and salt on the line. Nix had counted a total of sixty towers, a number Ordogan confirmed, around thirty meters high.

"See...We will be safe here," said Claradore. She had no reason to doubt him. Baba always said they would flee to Thanatopolis if the Molochians ever returned. It had also been her first contact with a moat, something she only heard about in fairy tales. Three layers of walls were separated by two extensive moats which she imagined must contain crocodiles or hippos. Claradore had laughed at that suggestion, claiming the city workers were not paid handsomely enough to collect the resulting waste.

"We should go through the gates. I have sent couriers to the palace. The Emperor is expecting us," said Ordogan.

"We shall move when Nix is ready to do so," simply said Claradore much to Ordogan’s suprise.

"Do not worry, Scholae. The heir can wait. He will understand..."

And the houses. From her vantage point, she could contemplate the array of red, blue and green rooves, this kind of jungle where roses, violets, tulips, amaranths and orchids shared their existence. Those were all plants starting as different colored seeds, growing with roots which could be deep or shallow depending on their needs before sprouting with frail or strong penduncles. Yet to the human eye, the sole element that mattered was its beauty and what that was worth to each human differed. "Humans were flowers after all," said Baba. All vied for water and nutrients from the soil. All had vivid and dark colors under the myriad of seasons. Having a plethora of multicolored plants living and breathing in harmony was a testament to a gardener’s success. She thought of the bouquets Baba brought to Miroconium for sale and how her choice of colors reflected that of Thanatopolis.

#emph[Look at it Baba, how beautiful this all is.] She hoped Baba could hear her, wherever she was.

Another landmark Nix was glad to see in-person was the Hippodrome, this ellipsoidal structure that was six stories high and almost matched the Palace Complex in height. There was no shortage of vivid descriptions of races in her books. Baba had even forbade her to attend the one time Viroconium hosted hortse racing, having apparently herself gambled seventeen drachmas on a fair mare that ended up being beaten by the most hideous horse Baba had ever laid her eyes upon.

"Who is your favorite team, Claradore?" asked Nix.

"The Rubies, my dear." He saw her doubt him. There were only four teams at Thanatopolis: the Silvers, the Golds, the Emeralds and the Sapphires according to Baba. "We are new to horse racing, my dear Nix. As a matter of fact, I founded it a decade ago. We are almost as large as the Silvers and the Golds. The Goddess be exalted if we manage to lift the trophy this season."

"Pffft, do not let his propaganda fool you, child. The Rubies are but leagues away from the Golds in sheer talent. Last season, the Gold rider was at least two laps ahead of the Red rider," said Ordogan. Nix let out a playful laugh.

"Do not laugh, my dear! The Red rider...That was me!" said Claradore.

How long did she and Claradore spend gazing at the city that brightened its surroundings in no other manner as Thanatopolis…Even Spartak loafed next to her, sitting lazily and wagging its tail. Seeing the quadriremes and quinqueremes sail, their small silhouettes seeking refuge within the ramparts, was something she could do all day.

Only when hersand Spartak’s stomachs beckoned for food did Claradore allow the party to take them within the city. As they went down Vitiatus’ Mount, Thanatopolis’ size magnified as if she was looking through a looking glass, the towers and walls now intent on showcasing their menace instead of awe.

How much time would it take for her to climb them? Five minutes was all she needed to climb over Baba’s house. No, maybe seven minutes if Baba was below yelling at her to come down at once. These walls with their towers...Perhaps fifteen to twenty minutes for the smaller intermediary ramparts and half an hour for the colossal outer structure, one that spanned at least eight kilometers. Those towers provided a good lookout for watching the constellations at night. Nix would have to buy a backpack to carry Spartak when she climbed. She had no money but Claradore could give her some.

Miroconium never had a queue at its entrance nor did Baba’s house. In fact, queues should not exist according to Nix. Waiting to enter some place was an affront to anyone’s patience. Why should anyone wait to get in? At the Sombrae Gate, there were three hundred caravans in-line, men and women dressed in some of the most varied clothing she had seen in her lifetime, speaking in all the languages that ever existed. Patricians wearing purple tunics, merchants donning a mix of Rauthengardian, Elysian and Medean attires. Even children with Molochian fur hats were playing in the mud, their parents struggling to keep them away from the clear water moat. She was convinced they would only let them in at dusk. #emph[This is absurd. Why?]

"My dear, why are you complaining? You are not of age to understand the concept of customs and taxes," said Claradore.

"What are those?" she asked, Ordogan’s companions chuckling at her question. #emph[What is funny about that?]

"Have you ever wondered how the Sarviatarians built that aqueduct and those walls? It is with what we call taxes, a small amount of money every citizen has to give to the Emperor. For example, that road near Baba’s house. That was made using Baba’s money, my dear Nix," said Claradore.

"Oooooooooooh!" She now knew why Baba loathed seeing that one man who knocked once every year at their door. The thief in prince’s clothing she would call him. Everytime, she would bake him biscuits. He always protested but ate the cookies nonetheless and went back empty-handed. It was someone Claradore told her was a tax collector.

Ordogan went ahead of the group, with a scroll in-hand. Nix saw the Limitanei at the gates saluting him before he motioned them to skip the line. #emph[Humans are not made for lines anyways.]

What caught her attention as she stepped into Thanatopolis’ walls was the ocean of humanity that flowed within narrow streets. Brown water rushed below stepping stones at intersections, no one needing to explain to her why those were required. Her group swam on this body of warmth and sweat, among the other schools of fish that somehow found their way amidst the divergent streams. Claradore pushed her at almost every step. The amount of details she had to take into account. Food stands waving at her to sell some sort of shrimp dumplings which smelled like the heavens to both her and Spartak, orators preaching the Faith’s scriptures, picturesque houses where women sprayed perfume from their balconies. A cacophony of donkeys, horses, shouts, prayers and other children bumping into her met her hearing. In contrast to the quietude of Baba’s house, here she would never be alone.

Nix had to stop when they reached the Hippodrome. Each of the arches in the arcades framed statues painted even more meticulously than those found in Miroconium. She recognized the Goddess, Emperor Vitiatius and his dove sitting on his lap marking his conversion to the Faith, Empress Zenobia with her four meters tall sarissa. To think that 80 000 people could be seated here the last time Baba had been here. The most mind-boggling story from her encyclopedia was that the Sarvitarians had simulated sea battles using the Hippodrome. In fact, Baba had watched a re-enactment of the Battle of Thunegard between the ailing Regnassian Empire and the ascending Sarvitarian Empire, her stories of how the stadium was filled with water and how the boats were carried into the premises filled Nix with jealousy

Threading in this sea of humans, she saw the Palace Complex creeping ever closer. The Sarvitarian and their successor states, the Medean and Tiarmat Empires, prided their rulers as being descendants of pagan gods. It was only when one was faced with the stunning colonnaded corridors leading to the hundred of marble stairs, free of any dust particle that one could believe that one dealt with divinities.

"See that building there my dear Nix, that will be your new home?" said Claradore.

#emph[Palace? Wait I do not understand...]

"I have long promised Baba that I would provide you the wings you need to soar in this world. After all, we who have seen the Gates of the Underworld must stay close to another, should we not?" said Claradore.

The palace, full of lavish dining rooms serving portions equivalent to five dinners with Baba. The palace, containing this extensive wardrobe for the Emperor under a Magister Sacra Vestis. She had read about the costumes designed for Medean royalty. The most wonderful was this purple gown on which a lady could wear a golden brocade laden with rich phoenix motifs she had aspired to own on the day of her wedding. She would give anything to be able to try out those outfits in front of the mirror or for someone to make a sculpture of her while wearing them.

She knew however that there was only one way to be able to commission as many fancy dresses as she pleased. A dream Baba had laughed in derision countless of times the past two years. Yet Baba could never imagine that Claradore would find her nor that they would live here.

"There is only one woman in the Known World who has a flagrance unique to her. That same lady can order clothes made of silk traded from the Unknown World with dyes extracted from snails living underwater. Those ball gowns, my gold coin, cost the totality of the Cachalot Kingdom’s treasury and are the envy of all young ladies in the Known World. Who is that woman?" had asked Baba.

"The Medean Empress," had said Nix.
