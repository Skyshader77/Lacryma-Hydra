A finger could be a harpoon. Thinking about it that way gave the Faith an aneurysm. Nix knew that much. Yet the Faith seldom showed their white cloaks around Baba’s abode. Baba claimed that was a good thing, thought Nix as her index finger melted, taking the color of blood. What would the Faithful say if they saw what her and Baba did every day.

#emph[Lance.] She felt her blood twirl, reshaping itself.

"The blood is the quill. The body is the canvas," once said Baba the first time Nix had tried it. Had she been four or five summers when Baba noticed it? Not that it mattered now.

She concentrated. Her blood tickled as it extended again and again. This tingling sensation that she could never part with...It drove her to heightened plane, one she had hoped more people could understand. The red filaments spliced from her fingers similar to a paint stroke. #emph[Beautiful.] Helices, foliums, butterflies. They espoused every form her mind commanded. Nix felt it. Touching the air and feeling its warmth and dampness. Air was made of water. What took the Faith hundreds of years to accept had been discovered by the Magi during the Age of Magic, Baba’s funniest story. Nix laughed, causing the filaments to vibrate in a hectic manner.

#emph[Stop.]

The filaments froze. She took a heavy breath. Slowly, her blood consolidated, the air becoming less palpable. She could no longer feel the water within it. Filaments which had been watery a few seconds ago were now as thick and solid as wood. Entwined with each other, they formed a tip, the same she had imagined when reading the tale of Regnant the Dragonslayer whose spear had pierced The Last Dragon. In her case, her finger was the lance. She brandished it high in the air, yelling from the top of her small lungs.

"Behold! The Lance of True Redemption," she yelled. Her high pitched voice making a poor imitation of what Regnant’s voice would have sounded a millennium ago. The crows perched on the tree next to her vacated their perch on the spot. A squirrel ran between her legs, chased by a ravenous fox. Her remaining audience, a pair of the ugliest toads she had ever seen croaked roughly. In her mind, they were applauding as they always had. #emph[Drats! Too loud!] She bowed before the two amphibians, pretending to collect tips.

"Do not fear, ladies and gentlemen as the show has merely started. And now for the encore!"

With her bloody spear, she struck at the stream she visited every week. Orange bellied salmon, blue mackerels and black dotted trouts. Baba had five recipes for each type of fish found in the river. Today, Nix’ interest was not in any of those but the large catfish she had been stalking for the past week. It had gained a feet since she last saw it. Just thinking about broiling it on Baba’s pan made her salivate. Nix already imagined its tender flesh roasting with ginger, thymes and black pepper being deposited on her hungry tongue.

Her finger had missed. She cursed. Baba would have slapped her wrist. She swore in the Imperial Tongue instead, Baba saying it was more acceptable than in the Classical Tongue.

She attacked the waters again. Another miss, the clearing’s quietude now perturbed by her screams and water splashing. Seconds, minutes passed, her nemesis dodging her every attempt to harpoon it. Nix never thought a fish’s brain could allow it to be so nimble. #emph[I need more.] Plunging it underwater, her right hand’s index finger now liquified. Its blood spun. Salt, small traces. She could touch it within the water molecules. It was the exact same texture as the one Baba used to season her plates. The filaments tied themselves to create another lance.

Nix smiled. She struck with the first lance. The fish dodged. Her second spear struck. She felt it. Blood and flesh on her fingers. Nix pulled her finger out of the water, the catfish’s body dangling from her harpoon. Her blood twirled again, hauling her prize back to the river’s banks. The catfish was brought to her arms, still flailing in a helpless manner. Nix took a whiff of it. Seawater, a taste she had the pleasure of masking with Baba’s spice collection.

Something tugged at her dress. Of all the animals she had come to know through her eleventh summer in the Known World, a bear cub was one of the most adorable. They were both of the same height and its brown eyes screamed pity.

"Are you not a cute one? I’m really sorry but this fish is for Baba and I... I can catch you a salmon if you want, little bear."

The bear sniffed at the catfish, widening its eyes akin to a young puppy. #emph[No, no, no, not for you!] She raised the catfish high in the air, causing the cub to whimper.

She started walking, the cub insisting on following her.

"No, stay. Stay! I can’t bring you home!" she said. The bear kept walking at the same pace as her.

A threatening roar behind her paralyzed her. One which dominated the forest. One which instilled fear upon her primordial senses. The legend Baba had told her spoke of the Men of Old who hunted giant versions of these beasts, one strike for their claws being enough to kill an adult. Nix had drawn a few of them after the scary bedtime stories. They had always been black with crimson eyes, oozing maleficence. Sometimes, she even gave them wings to make them as terrifying as the dragons she often confused them with. Nix wet herself. Her mind chastised her for her stupidity. She should have known. She should have known. Baba would scold her without remorse. Run. Run. The only option was to run.

She had never bolted as fast as she did, catfish in hands. The creature behind her bellowed, its ghastly cries echoing ever closer. Deers, pigeons and insects fled before her path. An earthquake seemed to rumble before her, its tremors approaching. Deafening wakes erupted in the river. Nix knew it outswam and outran her. Yet, her legs disobeyed her soul at this very moment. She could smell it, its animalist rage imbued with a desire to protect something dear to it just as Baba would shield her from any harm. #emph[The luck that cub has.]

The path back to Baba’s house now looked long and infinite. She could sense the thing’s raucous breath behind her. A tree. It could not climb trees. The second bright idea her brain could think of today. She barreled her way to the top of a tree, her catfish thrown at the roots. All those years at climbing the Hollow Tree next to Baba’s house paid off after all. Nix perched herself atop a branch, watching her pursuer, this mass of brown and reddish fur with claws as sharp as shark’s teeth. Its stench as unbearable. Feces mixed with fish and a faint trace of wildberries. It growled at her with utmost contempt. Baba had once told her that humans were the most feared species on this world. By seeing this monster, Nix realized that mankind was a terrible liar.

It circled the tree, snarling and grunting. In Baba’s stories, humans had always been the hunters not the hunted. That never made any sense to her. Humans were but bugs to the thing that pursued her. Her ancestors would have been displeased. Only the Goddess was aware if it was cursed with the fatal rage, the same possession that afflicted the deer Baba ended a year ago. They were not allowed to eat these fallen animals. The demon could jump hosts as Baba explained to her. All one could do was burn the husk.

She wanted to cry, curling herself into a ball. It started to get cold. She should have brought the new cloak Baba made for her on her birthday. What if she could not return? Would Baba go look for her? Would her puppy, Spartak, still wait for her at the doorstep? It still cried each time she shut the toilet door in front of it. Her bowels also screamed at her to relieve them. #emph[Just take the fish and leave me alone! I want to go home.] She spat at the colossal monster, not even inconveniencing it in the slightest. She dared not imagine Baba’s fury should she return past her curfew time.

Her bowels beckoned again. An idea Baba would have scolded her for hit her. Raising her tunic, she peed from the branch she sat on, ensuring the stream would trickle down on her adversary’s fur. #emph[How do like that, spawn of the Brood Mother?] If she was to depart from the Goddess’ land today, she would at least make Baba proud of her struggle. The monster sniffed its own skin, growling in disgust. It clawed at her tree, unable to reach her position. Nix’ tears of worry became tears of joy.

The creature seemed to listen to her or rather it grew tired of her whimpering before retreating. It emitted a nonchalant growl. She listened to each of its heavy steps. Only when she could no longer smell its foul odor nor hear other animals fleeing its might did she climb down her tree. #emph[Bless the Goddess!] Nix breathed a sigh of relief.

The sun had begun to set, painting the forest in an orange hue. Nix walked akin to a revenant home, the owls and cardinals not chirping back at her today. On other days, she would frolic like the heroes she read about in fairy tales, chanting with the robins and frogs she encountered. Once, she had even kissed a frog, hoping to get a prince out of it. The next day, her lips had swollen to a comical degree. Baba had slapped her own forehead when Nix had told her the frog’s color, forbidding her to touch any bright colored amphibian in the future.

Her feet kicked a few pebbles on the trail which still at some occasions showed the name of the Sarvitarian engineer or governor who helped maintain it. It had been useful to learn the Imperial Tongue.

"Baba, why do I have to learn two languages?" Nix had asked.

"The Classical Tongue is for the civilized and the Imperial Tongue is for the uneducated ," Baba had replied.

Smoke rose from Baba’s hut. Not so far away laid the village of Miroconium where Baba bought her books and where all the people her age lived. And further away were the two cities of Thanatopolis and Metarexia, places where one could contemplate their smallness according to Baba. The princesses and princes she had heard from in fairy tales lived there. Them, their beautiful costumes and the adventures the songwriters and poets wrote about in abundance.

"Baba, can I go there when I am older?" Nix had asked.

Baba would hug her with a smell reminiscent of home. Why Nix could not address her as Mother was beyond her. Baba would then open the encyclopedia the Sarvitarian Empire wrote on Thanatopolis during its rejuvenation, detailing with lavish hand drawings the monuments and landmarks from the Hippodrome to the Palace Complex. Why could Baba and she not live in this city was beyond her as well?

"I am too old to live next to emperors and empresses. Handling one in my home was enough for me," said Baba.

"But Baba, doesn’t the Emperor owe you a favor?"

Baba had cackled at that suggestion, not remembering the date when she saved a Sarvitarian Emperor from certain demise. It had been Emperor Vitiatus and if Nix had learned anything during her history lessons, it was that emperor died two hundred years ago. Who knew humans could live as long as Baba? Even Baba herself said that the average human being was lucky to be able to celebrate their fiftieth anniversary.

"The Emperor grew old as we all do, Nix. Do not think too much about life in the city. It is not a matter of how but when you will go there, my gold coin," said Baba.
