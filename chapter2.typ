"You are late," said Baba who was waiting at the door, spatula in hand. Only when they visited Miroconium was it that Nix noticed that it was out-of-the-ordinary that a house could stand on mushrooms or that one could cook these mushrooms without the building collapsing on itself. The other houses she saw in the village used bricks instead of wood, a strange decision for Nix. Baba had explained to her that the people there feared fire, another oddity for Nix to hear. Why fear fire when she could hold it in her hands to light candles?

"I saw it! The mother bear!" answered Nix as she smelled the broccoli stew that came from the chimney. Her stomach rumbled.

"The mother bear!?! You bratty gold! What were you doing near that? It is is breeding season for them!" said Baba.

"I was fishing," Nix said, pointing to the catfish she had recovered. She was expecting to be scolded for a full day, condemned to reread the events leading to the separation of the Sarvitarian Empire into the Tiarmat and the Medean Empire.

Baba slapped the top of Nix’ head before taking her into her arms. Much to her surprise, Nix was sure she could see a tear from in the corner of Baba’s left eye which was blue whereas the other brown eye glowered. Baba would never let her mention this again. Like in the animal world, softness could be interpreted as weakness. Nix had read as much from the authors of the Regnassian and Sarvitarian eras. "Do not do this to me again. You are not her. Bring Spartak with you the next time. He is old enough to know."

"But I can use magic! If you show me a new..."

Baba whisked her fingers. Nix had been too loud. Someone from the village could have heard her. Why this could be an issue, Nix did not know. The only thing she wanted was for Baba to teach her that spell.

"That is too dangerous for you, my treasure," said Baba.

"I am old enough!"

Baba raised her voice. Somehow it trembled just like every time she spoke about her, the other girl. "No! She said the same thing too! She said she was old enough...Oh children these days!" said Baba. Nix now swore she saw tears on Baba’s rugged face, a visage on which age had laid its work but had not completed it. It was a face which the villagers said had not changed in decades. Perhaps Baba had found that sacred Fountain of Youth Regnant the Dragonslayer had died seeking.

"But I am not her! I am not that man Claradore you keep complaining about either! You know that Baba!" Claradore. A name she had gotten used to hearing throughout her life. Was he her papa? Baba had never answered that question. He too had lived with Baba for some years. Claradore had to be her papa. Nix was jealous of his exploits, him having mastered the blood harpoons when he was but a year younger than her. Baba would always console her saying he had an advantage.

"The Age of Magic is Claradore’s home," said Baba when she was not ranting about him bringing another child to the house. Nix had argued that more children meant that more people could aid with her chores. It seemed Baba spent her days riding a broom or collecting berries and mushrooms. Surely she did not mind more helpers seeing how the dishes accumulated in the kitchen.

"I know you are not her nor him...You are you...My little gold coin..." said Baba. #emph[Has she always looked sad when talking about them?] At night, Nix would sneak out from her bunk bed to salvage food only to find Baba crying while muttering their names. #emph[What did they do to Baba?] Baba never talked about them no matter how obstinate Nix asked, a maze of secrets she harbored.

All Nix could guess was that they were also taught in the arts by Baba with Claradore being the most talented. Had they even lived all together at the same time? Perhaps not. The other spot on the bunk bed had been salvaged to build a chair long before Nix’ time. The other girl and Nix had been the same: brought here as babies. On another hand, Claradore found Baba. Baba said only women sought her. In fact, Claradore was aware, before he met her, that Baba was a Magi. The sole possession that remained of him at Baba’s house was that notebook in which he drew places Nix had never heard of. From floating palaces high in the skies to warriors riding dragons, Claradore’s sketchbook was something to behold, an imagination capable of generating an entire universe. And then there were the spiders. To Nix, the exactitude of Claradore’s drawings or rather his obsession with a spider’s anatomy was bewildering. There was this passion and melancholy from the way he depicted their eight eyes and their mouths. Maybe he had been hired to illustrate the books Baba gave to her. It would make a good story.

"Then, show me how to do it. I want to make that bear run away like you did with those wolves! I will be able to protect you and Spartak the next time those wolves come to the farm," said Nix.

Baba breathed a sigh of exasperation. "The Goddess damn you children, making this old woman reveal all her secrets one at a time... I will show it to you, on one condition: that you skin me another coat for the winter."

Nix jumped around like a giddy child. Finally, she was going to learn it. The wolves raiding their farm yelped much the first time Baba did it, morphing her entire body into the semblance of a red armored knight with shield and bloodied lance. Nix had applauded for almost an hour, begging Baba to teach her that spell.

"Yes! It’s a promise...What is there for supper? I am hungry," said Nix.

"Salt your fish and put it away in the kitchen. I made some pork ribs to go with the broccoli stew."

There were three knocks on the old bamboo door. #emph[A customer?] They always came at night. As if they were ashamed of it. Nix never understood why. She was about to head to her bunk bed, the sound almost causing her to slip on that one uneven step Baba had built out of spite.

"You will understand as you grow older," simply said Baba. The door opened, revealing a girl not much older than Nix. If she had to guess, the girl would be at most fifteen. Unlike Nix, her skin was not as tanned. #emph[Not an Elysian, like me.] In addition, she wore earrings shaped in the form of doves. #emph[A believer.] Maybe after the ceremony, Nix would ask her where to buy those.

"How much?" asked the girl, her green eyes betraying her wariness.

"Twelve drachmas," said Baba. The same lie she told for the past year.

The girl clasped Baba’s hands. "I can’t afford this. Please."

"Go home, I am not offering this service anymore," lied Baba. Why did Baba have to lie? Nix knew it was related to the Faith. The Goddess forbade it for a reason she could not pick up. Yet Baba held the ceremony at least four times a year.

"Please! You have to understand! I had no choice! He forced me! Please! Please! Please! You are the only one who does this!" pleaded the girl as she put herself on her knees before Baba. The few times Baba became a Goddess to these girls.

Baba began closing the door. "You are putting all of us at risk, girl. If the Faith finds out about this..."

The girl put her foot at the door’s hinge. "No! Please! The bishop! The bishop sent me! I-I had no choice. I-I couldn’t refuse him."

"The bishop?" Baba said, her hand placed on her forehead.

"It is true, madam! I swear by the Goddess! Please! You have to help me! I cannot live with this!"

Baba groaned. She always ended up yielding and Nix knew it. Bargaining was never her strong suit. None of the lies managed to hide the truth: Baba would always do it, free of charge. "Grab the silphium, my little gold coin," said Baba to Nix.

Nix opened a jar of herbs. The plant she was looking for had yellow flowers and stumpy leaves. On a normal day, Baba would extract its sap as odiferous as it was savorous. She had an exquisite recipe involving sauteed the plant to make the stalks crusty and crunchable. Nix tried her best to hide her annoyance at the herb being used on a complete stranger, an expensive one on top of it. Legend has it that the Sarvitaurian Emperors kept a cache in their treasuries. During the last days of the Tiarmat Empire, the plant was as valuable as gold.

Baba boiled the plant, telling her client to take off her clothes. Sometimes they screamed. A lot. Once, a middle-aged lady cried throughout the entire night. Nix thought she had lost her hearing from the ordeal. This is why she had to gag them while dodging the flurries of kicks and nail swipes. How one could strike the people that they asked for help was beyond her. She hoped this one would miss all of her hits, her last bruise taking months to heal.

The girl was laid down on a fur mat made of deer hide. Nix gave her a spoonful of soup, in the hopes that this would soothe prior to the ceremony. She could hear the girl’s frenetic heartbeat from here. Why were other women as anxious as this during the service?

"You will understand as you grow older," said Baba again. #emph[Every time. but I am old enough now. I should know.]

Silphium. In the simmering pot, it smelled like Baba or Nix associated it with Baba. She did not know what came first. Nix never sniffed her own mother. She had assumed every mother smelled of silphium. Fifteen minutes under high heat were needed to create the concoction.

"What is your name, girl?" said Baba.

"Hippolita," said the girl. #emph[Typical name of the Imperial Tongue.]

"How old is the bishop?" said Baba.

"Seventy two," said Hippolita. Baba winced in utter disgust. Seventy-two was the highest answer Nix had ever heard. #emph[Aren’t large numbers a good thing?]

By the time the recipe sizzled, Baba collected two cups in a bowl.

"Will it hurt? Please tell me that it won’t," asked the girl.

"Yes," said Nix who seized the girl’s legs. #emph[Please don’t kick me in the face.]

Baba poured the bowl into Hippolita’s mouth. Her customer gagged in an instant, her body contorting itself in demonic violence. Baba restrained her arms while her legs gyrated and flailed, Nix’s arms aching in pain. The screams. Nix rolled her eyes. The part she absolutely adored was upon them. The girl let out wails that ruptured through the small house, shaking a younger Baba’s portrait hung on the walls . Wails so strident that they could have burst the cracked windows. Wails so unholy even wolves and grown bears dared not approach the house at night. Nix wanted to slap the girl. #emph[I am definitely losing my hearing for this.] She held on in spite of the throbbing pain in her shoulders. They spent ten minutes. Ten excruciating minutes holding their client.

Pee. It was all over Nix’ face. She was thankful anything solid had not come out of the girl unlike the previous ones. Her hands craved for a towel. Hippolita’s spasms had been relentless. The hot bath could not come any sooner.

The violent cries stopped when blood leaked from Hippolita’s lower parts. #emph[It’s over. It’s finally over.] Nix felt her grip loosen up.

"Do not look, Hippolita! It is not for the faint of hearts," said Baba.

Baba gestured her to bring a towel. Hippolita was drenched in sweat, blood and urine. Another mess for Nix to clean up. #emph[Maybe Baba should stop giving the service after all.] She grabbed the mop and began swiping the desecrated floor. The entire house would continue to stink for the next week, Baba asking her to buy some perfume at Miroconium every time.

"It is done, girl. Go home and tell the other women to not come here again," said Baba. Another lie. #emph[Why do you have to lie again Baba? I don’t understand.]
