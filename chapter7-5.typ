Spartak's sudden barks caused Nix to fall off her bed. Her head banged the cold ceramic floor. Nix cursed.  

"You oaf! I am not to be disturbed in my sleep!" said Nix.

Spartak whimpered. It had more than tripled in size in the last eight years. A beam of sunlight almost blinded her left side. The realization struck her. _I am late,_ thought Nix.

A spider tattoo was now present on her back. It was identical to Claradore's. In fact, he was the one who insisted on drawing it. She ran towards her closet, almost toppling her painting of Baba's house. Jars of paint vibrated. Paintbrushes rolled on the floor. Serena had told Nix countless times to put away her arsenal of art supplies once she was done painting. This advice was only applicable for someone who could finish a painting in a single sitting. Nix always spent days or weeks staring at her work before doing a single paint stroke.
Their common room had become an obstacle course according to Serena, one that Spartak had often the pleasure of wrecking with is bulky frame.

At this current pace she would more than significantly late. Nix closed her eyes. 
She felt her body melt. What used to be her arms started to gyrate by an odd rhythm. Her blood vibrated, every wavelength coursing through her heart. Something clicked deep within her. The filaments of blood spliced themselves. 
She felt herself stand at two different positions, sensing the sound of two heartbeats.

She opened her eyes, having now a 360 degrees vision. Two Nixes now stood in the room. Nix grinned.

"Do my hair and empty Spartak's litter," said Nix to her doppelganger.

"At your command, your August Majesty," said the doppelganger.

And so Nix and her twin completed their morning routine. Throughout the entire, Spartak's head swung between one Nix to the other. Her dog never truly grasped what this new spell entailed. It barked with agitation every time the other Nix passed through its body.

Nix often ordered her duplicate to perform cleaning duties while she did errands for Claradore. Being at two places simultaneously allowed to maximize her income.
With time, she also learned how to have her doppelganger do other things than menial tasks. Blood blades and harpoons could now be used to fish.

When the other Nix had completed her tasks, Nix calculated that she had bought herself around ten to fifteen minutes. This somewhat compensated for the delay of thirty minutes she would inflict on her student.

Her fingers snapped. The other Nix liquefied herself and melted within Nix's legs.

She scurried to put on her brown hooded tunic. The only good thing in her current predicament was that the Emperor was not going to attend her lessons. Nix applied two touches of her perfume, this kaleidoscope of creamy florals, lemon and mango. If Claradore was to be believed, Baba in her youth once adored this flagrance, even wearing it at her wedding. The bottle might have costed her half of her monthly salary, but it was worth the price, seeing Majorian's reaction when they smelled it.

Spartak barked.

"I am aware that I am late! You do not need to remind me, you oaf!"

Her dog exited the room. Nix soon bolted after it.

Her room was situated in the Royal Apartments of the Palace Complex. However, because she was a handmaiden, she was obliged to live on the lower floors. Claradore's patronage had brought her her own room, a privilege only reserved for the most beloved of commoners.

Nix made her way through the spiral staircase that connected the Emperor's apartment to the servants'. Stained glass and frescoes revolved around the stairs.
She saw the Battle of Megidollanean Plains where the Tiarmat Empire and its allies prevailed over the Molochian Horde. Every detail in the soldiers, generals and casualties found in this panoramic work of art was painstakingly drawn from their cuirasses to their irises. She felt the courage and rage in their visages as if she was with them on the battlefield with her own oval shield, defending against the Molochian heavy cavalry. Nix only wished she could convey the same level of humanity in her own paintings.

Atop the ceiling, the scene of the Last sighting of the Goddess unveiled before her eyes. Serena had petitioned the Emperor to hide this fresco to no avail. 
Sad stories never pleased Serena. The artists had depicted the Goddess rising among her incredulous believers, carrying the body of her son to the Gates of the Underworld. As the name of the fresco suggested, no one had ever seen the Goddess since. 

By the time she reached the Emperor's floor, she was wheezing. Marble now replaced ceramic as the flooring. Colonnaded corridors greeted her unlike the gloomy and dark rows on her floor. Excubitores clad in chainmail and their renowned golden capes patrolled the premises. 

The door to the Prince's study room was wide open. Spartak let itself in. 
Nix followed.

The scent of old books permeated the air. All walls in the room were covered by book shelves. Her inner child would have been jealous. All encyclopedias ever written by the Sarvitarian and the Medean Empires could be found here. There were even texts and scrolls recovered from the burned Library of Oxnia sacked by the Donians a century prior. If Nix was a Purpleborn, she would indulge in reading all of them.

The prince, Ralens the Younger and the Comes Ordogan turned their gaze towards her.

"You are late," said Ordogan. He was a living example that some men simply did not age. Maybe his Molochian origins had a hand in this. He wore a plumed helmet alongside a Molochian horse archer's fur coat.

"Forgive me, Comes...I overslept," said Nix.

A map of the eastern provinces laid on the study tables. Amateurishly painted horse figures and infantrymen were placed at the Medean and Elysian forts. Ralens the Younger fiddled with an archer toy soldier in his hands. He was coiled in a purple blanket and sat barefooted.

"Comes, you cannot demand punctuality for an Elysian. You have shown five minutes ago that even the Elysian Emperor fails to wake before a battle."

"She is your math instructor, is she not? The concept of time is intrinsically related to mathematics," said Ordogan.

Nix never understood why Claradore had asked her to become the Prince's tutor when she was only fifteen summers. In her opinion, the Crimson Spider tired of financing hers and Serena's antics in the capital. He had been particularly upset when Nix asked for front row seats to the chariot races. The same year also saw Nix lose a bet fifty denarii when her favorite charioteer sprained his ankle during a race. 

"Are you ready to begin the lesson, my Prince?" said Nix.

"Did you know Father will render his decision today?"

Nix raised an eyebrow. Clearly, the prince was trying to delay the class.

"Which decision?" asked Nix.

"Whether Ordogan would become a Magister Militum or not. The Excubitores should summon him anytime now."

The half-Molochian was as serene as a swan on a lake. To her knowledge, Ordogan's wife will divorce him should the decision be unfavorable. But it was unfair for the man. The delays in his promotion could not be attributed to bureaucracy nor incompetence but due to the interference of another Purpleborn.

Nix sighed. "You will not escape learning about the golden ratio, my prince. Show the abacus," said Nix.

A knock came on the door. It was an Excubitore. _I woke for nothing today,_ thought Nix.

Nix chose to follow Ordogan and Ralens as they made their way to the Emperor's bedroom. The ruler of the Medean Empire seldom left the confines of his chambers lately. The court was already whispering. At eighty summers, the Gates of the Underworld awaited the monarch. 

The smell of scented candles greeted her.  The Emperor, Ralens the Elder, laid on the bed. Jaundice had taken hold of his own prideful visage. Blood stained tissues littered the right side of the bed. Nix saw that the entire room had been redecorated with effigies of the Goddess. White sheets, white curtains, the Goddess be damned, even the furniture was now white. 

Ordogan bowed down. Nix did the same.

"Your August Majesty summoned me," said Ordogan.

"Domitian has been bestowed the title of Magister Militum," said Ralens the Elder.

Stern and direct. Nix liked it. However, Domitian was a man whose brain could have gone missing during his childhood. How the princess Livia was so enamored with such a cretin was a question with no answer. Nix quizzed Ordogan for his reaction. She was disappointed. Ordogan did not flinch. 

"I understand," said Ordogan.

"Why, Father?  Ordogan has defeated the Grey Raider a fortnight ago in your name!" protested Ralens the Younger.

"The decision is final, Prince of the Medeans," said the Emperor.

"Men will die because of Domitian, Father! Even I know that! The men have no love for Domitian!"

_Yet the Emperor has much love for his daughter,_ thought Livia. The whole ploy reeked of Livia's jasmine and rose flagrance. As soon as her father became bed ridden, the princess spent all of her nights in his room, reading stories of old to her father. Ordogan himself was content on writing reports about his battles with the Grey Raiders. Claradore had told him that proofs of competency were insufficient in the face of Livia's way of conducting diplomacy. Nix did not deny that the princess' honeyed tongue combined with having the most beautiful body in the Empire could sway any man. Ordogan himself was a taciturn man. When it came to promotions granted by Ralens the Elder himself, words mattered more than actions.

The Emperor's cough brought her back to Ordogan's failure.

"The princess Livia must be rejoicing," said Nix.

Ordogan sighed.

"The Goddess have mercy on all of us," said Ordogan.

"Out! All of you!" rasped the Emperor.

The Excubitores led the trio outside of the Emperor's chambers. Nix waddled back to the Princes' Room.

"It is disappointing," said Ralens the Younger. He smiled playfully. "I surely hope this does not lead you to bend the knee to Nosrau."

"My loyalty lies with to your father, my Prince."

Nix laughed. The Medean throne knew better than to antagonize their generals. The memory of Flavius Eugenius who defected to the Elysian Empire after the Medean Emperor Bibulus exiled him remained fresh in the minds of the military elite.

"Ordogan has other issues to attend, my Prince. Eleni will not be pleased."

The thought of Ordogan becoming celibate ran through her mind. Had she been younger, this would have been an enticing thought. Yet she was sworn to Majorian for the time being. It was a shame. Who would not try to besiege the Lion of the East's heart? Years ago, Ralens the Elder attempted to betroth Livia to Ordogan when she came of age. The princess flatly refused and chose the imbecile Domitian, the heir to a patrician family instead. Nix would have not made the same mistake in Livia's place.

When she returned to her chambers with Spartak, she dragged out a portrait of the Man in White of the closet. His features were grotesquely exaggerated with an aquiline nose, cheeks as swollen as a frog's and eyes bulging from their sockets. 

_Eight years,_ thought Nix.

She slid a set of darts from underneath her bed and threw one dart at time at the Man in White.
