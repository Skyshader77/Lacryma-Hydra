Baba was sewing another tunic for her. She had acquired some red silk from the village, at a reasonable price, the cherry on top of the cake. How was a question that Baba always teased her about. Maybe it came from a princeling’s tomb, an answer which would always frighten Nix who had a total of seven outfits, all made by Baba, some of the fabric even lasted her entire childhood.

"Do you want a motif on it?" said Baba. The patterns and embroidery Baba made were out of this world. Nix looked at the Tiarmat hydra on her robe, its five heads entertwined with one another. It seemed to hiss with the energy of despair, a struggle long lost. The inspiration had been obvious: the famous painting where the Molochian centaur was locked in a fateful battle with the hydra who wrapped its venomous fangs on its enemy’s limbs. Nix admired how all of the heads expressed their anger and demoralization in a different way. She had little to no sympathy for the centaur who had willingly ventured into the hydra’s den. #emph[The hydra has children too, like the mother bear. If someone went into my nest, I would attack them too.]

"A phoenix. Can it be a phoenix this time?" said Nix.

Baba nodded, tucking her under her bed cover. "A phoenix it will be then. Have you taken a liking to the Medean Empire now, my gold coin?"

"I want something else than a hydra. I have already five tunics with hydras."

"It is a shame the Tiarmat no longer exists."

That answer always disappointed Nix. The Tiarmat Empire, one of the successors of the Sarvitarian Empire who authored much of the encyclopedias she devoured, gone before she was even born. Baba told her about the times when the legions still patrolled the imperial roads next to Miroconium, the days when she still received shipments of grain from the provinces now occupied by the Cachalots. Back then, cities did not need walls. Children could play outside the makeshift palissades without meeting a single Molochian. In the golden days of the Sarviatarian Empire, Baba had travelled extensively, some of the dishes Nix ate in came from Persiphon, other utensils were forged at Cyclonia, now ruled by the Vyrmogothians. #emph[How lucky Baba was lucky to have lived under the Sarvitarians’ protection.]

Baba had told her the tales of the first time the Known World faced the Molochians. It had been the only time she agreed with the Faith. Molochians, the Scourge of the Goddess, men who were drawn with such grotesquery in Nix’ books that she got nightmares for three consecutive days after reading that chapter. They were depicted as horned devils with teeth larger than the mother bear’s, their skin as red as the Medean phoenix and their eyes devoid of pupils. It was then that Nix noticed how the lack of eye contact could sour any first impression.

The novels spoke about these men who ate children, slaughtering all before them. One of the greatest sections Nix had ever read described how all barbarian people: Cachalots, Rauthengardians, Clovians, Domaceans and Vyrmogothian banded together with the Tiarmat and Medean Empires, clashing with the invaders during the Battle of the Megidollaean Plains. Even the Elysian Empire from which she was supposedly from, sent contingents. So much of Nix’ time had been spent drawing sketches of that titanic struggle for the waning empire’s survival, works of art that Baba framed in her own room.

Of course, Nix could never hope to compete with Claradore’s skills. A single of the mandibles that man drew had more details than any of the hydras Nix showed to Baba with enthusiasm.

"Baba! I’m never going to be as good as Claradore," Nix said.

Baba would always pinch her cheekbones. "You don’t have to be as good as Claradore, my little treasure. Look at the variety of your drawings. All that boy ever drew was those accursed spiders," Baba said.

"Why did he only draw spiders?"

Baba would make this exaggerated sigh. Somehow despite her endless complaining about him, there was this ember that lit within Baba’s pupils every time she talked about Claradore’s aptitudes in the magical arts. Nix always imagined what her life could have been had both of them shared Baba’s roof simultaneously. Having someone who bested her at both magic and art. A challenge she would welcome. With enough training, she could do it: surpass him and make Baba applaud her. Baba would then never complain about Claradore again.

"His...misfortunes made him obsessed with spiders. He has lived through … exceptional events."

#emph[You did not answer the question, Baba!]

One of these days, one of these days, she would ask Baba for the entire story on Claradore and that other girl who stayed here. Who were they really? How good was that other girl with magic? Were they Elysians too? Were they also as old as Baba right now? Why spiders of all things for Claradore? Did they also read the same books as her? What did they think about Regnant the DragonSlayer? Did they also want to save the Tiarmat Empire like she does? What were their favorite color? So many questions.

But the questions that Nix wanted answers to the most...Baba had also promised to talk about Nix’ parents on her sixteenth’s birthday. #emph[Only five more years.] No matter how much Nix had insisted on that topic, Baba would always rebuke her, claiming that she was not old enough to understand. Sixteen. Baba had promised to bake her her favorite recipe for a cake, one she had not done in a century. Nix had seen it in the cookbook. Baba had called it the sponge cake, its secrets derived from the Unknown World itself. One had to mix eggs, mint, flour, sugar and pandan leaves, which could only be obtained from the fringes of the Elysian Empire in order to make this delectable fantasy that made Nix salivate intensively everytime she read the recipe. She could not wait to be sixteen.

"But the Last Tiarmat Emperor, Darnik! He can reclaim his throne like Regnant the Dragonslayer did!" said Nix.

Baba burst into a series of playful laughs, almost dropping the tunic she was working on. She rocked her chair with such force that Nix was worried that she might fall off.

"My gold coin, Darnik is not Regnant the Dragonslayer. The last Tiarmat Emperors were not the charming princes your books, written by the Medeans, claim them to be."

"What do you mean, Baba?"

"What if you were to write a book about yourself? Would you ever describe yourself as feeble, as incompetent, as a mere puppet to the generals and eunuchs who you are supposed to command? Of course not, my gold coin, trust me. I have had a Sarvitarian Emperor stay in this very room you now occupy. He too wrote himself like the fairest of all men, the most intelligent of all. He who lost while outnumbering Rauthengardians of all barbarians made himself as a fantastic general in his memoirs. Oh the agony of having read that turd of a book he sent me as a thank you note," said Baba.

It was Nix’ turn to start laughing. Baba had told her many stories of that Sarvitarian Emperor requiring her assistance to do the most basic of things from washing his bloodstained clothing, folding laundry to skinning a duck. The sight of Tiarmat, Medean, Sarvitarian Emperors being followed by a swarm of eunuchs attending their every need like a queen bee made her giggle. Once, Nix had the audacity to draw a dwarf acting as a toilet for an emperor. That drawing. It was the only masterpiece Baba helped her personally complete. It now hung next to what Nix assumed was a wedding portrait from the heyday of the Sarvitarian Empire.

"Maybe Darnik just needs the Goddess to help him expel the Rauthengardians from Metarexia..." said Nix.

"Oooooh, I would not count of that woman..." said Baba.

"Why not? Doesn’t the Faith say she is almighty and the most powerful woman in history? The books say she can destroy dragons with lightning bolts. What can the Rauthengardians do against her?"

Baba stopped sewing. #emph[Did I say something wrong?] She pondered looking at Nix’s room. Only then did Nix notice that she never cleared the cobwebs Baba had asked her to clean up yesterday. Somehow, she shared this bad habit with that man, Claradore, according to Baba. How did she not come to fear spiders like Baba and the girls in the village was a mystery even to Baba. Spiders, these allies that ate roaches and mosquitoes, waiting with tedious patience for prey to enter their domain. Spiders, these creatures that were not insects because they had eight legs instead of six. There was something admirable or rather elegant about that quality. Why run after your food when you could simply watch them from your bed while they inevitably land on your territory? #emph[It is a smart way of hunting.]

"The Goddess...There is a lot of things the Faith’s scripture do not tell you. What can I tell you? She may be the strongest woman in the Known World but she will surely not help the girl we assisted that other day, nor the others," said Baba.

"Why? Why doesn’t she help these women like you do? What is stopping her from doing it? She was there when the Rauthengardian deposed Darnik. Why was she not there in the Battle of the Megidollaean Plains? Why did she let the Tiarmat Empire fall? Why is she never there in the books when people need her? I don’t understand. People always pray for her to be there!"

Baba touched Nix’ braid, five-stranded, the same style as her own. The village women had told her that this fashion was outdated since the beginning of the Molochian invasions. Nix never paid much attention to that. She felt she looked like one of these women whom the artists of the Sarvitarian Empire’s zenith loved to sculpt. Perhaps one day, a sculptor would ask to make a painted bust out of her similar to the hundreds she had seen at Miroconium. Moreover, her hairstyle was simple and pretty, why change it?

"Maybe you can go Metarexia and ask her yourself when you are older. You have read the books. Every year, the Goddess meets the Faithful at Metarexia during the Day of Humility," said Baba.

"If she is too busy, why can’t someone else do it? Someone who can use magic?"

"You will find out when you grow older that no matter how strong you think you are, it will never be sufficient to save all of what you love. Such is life, my gold coin," said Baba.
