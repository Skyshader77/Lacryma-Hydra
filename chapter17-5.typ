She borrowed a deer's form and ran after the Magrub Dogas. The fell creatures 
seemed to ignore her as they flew in the direction of the imperial capital, still 
carrying Majorian's moaning body. His languish echoed through the night, guiding her towards what Nix assumed was the fiends' lair.

Under normal circumstances, Nix should have tried to summon Claradore's Artifice. The situation would have demanded the Crimson Spider's immediate attention. But only silence answered her summoning cants. What else could preoccupy Claradore at this hour? Her thoughts touched the vast amount of gold and manpower required to man a Forge. The engine had to be extracted from the depths of the Underworld. 
Fresh corpses had be brought. There were few entities in the Known World who had access to a reliable supply of bodies. Moreover, under the reign of Ralens the Elder, the Known World has known twenty years of peace. Hence, only a state could 
operate the Forge. It could be the Medean Empire as Claradore would have known of it. Who else then? The Elysians? Why reveal such a weapon in a piecemeal manner? 
Any rational adversary would have used the monsters to flood the border forts. No, this enemy pinpointed her, a Magi and Nix had to learn how they identified her.

Nonetheless, Claradore would understand. No plan survived contact with the enemy's shield wall. Nix would venture in the beasts' den.

Her deer legs sprinted across the dark grass. By contrast running as a human now felt like walking. Rain clouds dissipated above leaving a full moon. The old Sarvitarian road zig zagged across fields of orchids and vineyards. Nix 
soared among plains and concrete, feeling as if her hooves shot out lightning bolts. This speed. She could have reached the far edges of the Known World in 
mere days had she wanted to.
The outline of Charov's Aqueduct soon unraveled behind hills.
The lights of the Palace Complex glittered across the Strait of Cyclonius. 
The Magrub Dogas banked towards the Exiles' Island, a prison in all but name for 
the purpleborn who had fallen out of favor with the Emperor. The fiends made turns around the island. One by one they landed, swallowed by the island's ominousness.

Nix vacated the deer's body. She unveiled her crimson wings, launching herself towards the creatures' lair.

The smell of decomposed flesh permeated the air. Whatever malefic aura leaked from the Forge desecrated anything from bricks, marble and glass. Black ooze stained the walls. Nix did not dare to touch the substance. She could hear its 
breath. She could smell its mere presence that indicated the living rejected it.

Down the stairs, the snarl of creatures could have maddened anyone. Cries of rage,
sorrow and betrayal. Nix wondered if the fiends' human soul still clung to their corrupted vessel. That was a futile thought. One better left believing they were empty husks that needed deliverance. 

The steps led her to a hallway of cells. Half of them were filled with Magrub Dogas whose teeth were salivating as they stared at her. Nix braced for an imminent scream, a wail or any signal that would cause whatever guards there was 
to swarm her location. Instead, the Magrub Dogas' eyes continued to follow her behind their bars. She found vestiges of their lost humanity within their 
gaze, a mix of curiosity, indifference and fear. 
_At least they won't alarm any guards_ thought Nix.

"Where is my friend?" asked Nix. She waited. Five seconds. Ten seconds. 
Blue eyed, red eyed, green eyed stares. No answer. She was an idiot. It was obvious these creatures were incapable of speech.

The unpleasant news were that these ruins had become a labyrinth. Majorian's legs had been severed. Nix had to cauterize the wound at least. _Where are you, Majorian?_ thought Nix.

A man's voice rung through the hall. Boniface's voice. Nix muffled a laugh. Of course. Why had she not thought of it? The Faith had been responsible for this. 
The Faith who had rid the Known World of Magic now resorted to a Forge for the Goddess knew what. 

"There were three Magi to dispose of. None of our objectives were met," said Alexander's voice. Nix almost lost her balance. The Giant added another degree to her polynomial equation. She had just carved a bloody path through four Magrub Dogas hours earlier. Having to deal with another surprise was undesirable

"Then we forge more. The Magi are bound to crack under sheer numbers," said Boniface's voice.

"And where do you suggest we fetch corpses? Our Inquisitors can only do so much."

"The Elysian and Medean Empires stand at the brink of war. The boy king is respected by none."

"You assume we have the luxury of time, Disciple. The Magi know of the Forge's existence. They will come."

"Then I trust you will be able to shield us, Excellency."

"There is one more thing. The Creatures brought a live specimen for us this time."

Nix ran for the voices' position.

"What shall we do with it?"

"Mercy..." croaked Majorian's voice.

_Stay with me! Stay with me!_ thought Nix.

"The Forge accepts living ingredients. Throw him in," said Alexander.

"No, no, no, no, no!" screamed Nix as she barreled her way through the stone corridors and the hordes of imprisoned monsters.

Alexander's command ignited the sound of gears spinning and bellcranks grinding metal. A loud hiss reverberated through the ruins. Nix cursed, turning left, turning right. She had to save Majorian.

Parabolas of blinding light flashed in the corridor. Majorian's pleas thundered though the dungeon. She stumbled into more and more black ooze, her bare feet 
landing into the viscous substance. Every step she took revolted her skin. 

She arrived in a place of architectural deterioration, covered in discording marble assembled from all empires that had lived. It displayed the crude inelegance of the Faith at every turn from the bronze wear around the porticos to the lines of fungi that traced every arch. It was the nerve of the radial network that was the dungeon.

Men of the Crucible lined up before a cyclopean structure resembling a metallic gate. Black steam emanated from the door. Metalwork not from the living world 
manufactured the sprawling complex of gears, bell cranks, pistons and pumps that 
fueled the Forge. 

Majorian was placed on a tray. Men of the Crucible held it inches away from the Forge's opening. Dry air escaped Nix's lips as she tried to scream for his name. 
Alexander and Boniface stood before the contraption, the latter's eyes glowing with a child's sense of wonder. Alexander clapped his hands. The Men of the Crucible threw the wailing Majorian into the Forge.

A vertiginous silence ran. Nix fell on her knees.

_You would never abandon me, wouldn't you?_ rung Majorian's voice in her ears for what appeared to be an eternity.

And yet she did abandon him to that Forge. Certain doom awaited them. If she had known that the night spent in the Livia's room would be their last, she would have savored it to the last minute. She would have planted one more kiss on their lips. She would have cooked one more of their favorite carrot porridge.  
She stood there motionless letting her betrayal of their vow assail her heart and bones. The Men of the Crucibles' chants and prayers added insult to injury. 

She would kill them all. 

Her Majorian and her Baba, stolen by these vile men. Right when she finally acquired the strength to not fear them anymore. It was not fair. It never was.
One by one, she would tear their rib cages and pry out their still beating hearts and send their remains through the Forge. Yes that was a sound plan.

Alas, the Forge would not let her enact it. It hissed anew, emitting orange 
steam. Metallic screeching tore through the ceiling. The Forge's inner lights flickered between crimson, white and gold. Wide smiles were drawn on Boniface and Alexander's faces.

A tall shadow emerged from the Forge. Two still human arms were permanently attached to their visage, now sheathed in antler's horns. Its torso stood on four equine legs. And these eyes, as red as rubies, seemed to be in constant mourning. 
Phoenix wings sprouted from its back. 

_Majorian?_ thought Nix.

"Welcome back to the world of the living," said Alexander.

The thing called Majorian sang with a voice as elegant as it was frightening. This time, there was a duality of female and male voices in its vocal cords. 
Its intonation spoke of confusion and loss. Such was the beauty in the melody that Nix could have wept on the spot. That creature was an unholy miracle, capable of emulating all instruments in the Known World from water organs to harps.

"How unique...What to do with this one, your Excellency," asked Boniface.

"The Faith has no use for this mockery of a bard."

"Then let the alchemists and inquisitors toy with him. Perhaps something can be gained from dissecting it."

The thing called Majorian made an expression synonymous with terror at the mention of that word. Nix must have imagined it. Magrub Dogas did not have emotions.

Alexander made a sudden turn of his head. Nix had no time to react. Their eyes met.

"So the Magi comes for their friend. Come little girl, do not be afraid."

Nix was old enough to know not to trust anything that came out of a Faithful's dirty mouth. She coiled her arm, melting it into a blood blade. Boniface yelled. 
Men of the Crucible surged towards her position. 

She leapt in the air, liquefying her entire body. _Chariot,_ thought Nix. Every drop of her blood gyrated, congregating into a spiked wheel. She spun and spun, 
feeling the surrounding air gaining velocity. 

There was the issue of Alexander. There was not a single scratch on his body. Not even his clothes had seen harm. What were his intentions? Were Cardinals not allies? Why had he not helped his compatriot?

Yet the Giant stood still, content with simply witnessing her art. She did not like this. The more her gaze was fixated on him, the more every nerve in her body screamed for her to flee this place at once.
