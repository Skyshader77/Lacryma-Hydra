She borrowed a deer's form and ran after the Magrub Dogas. The fell creatures 
seemed to ignore her as they flew in the direction of the imperial capital, still 
carrying Majorian's moaning body. His languish echoed through the night, guiding her towards what Nix assumed was the fiends' lair.

Under normal circumstances, Nix should have tried to summon Claradore's Artifice. The situation would have demanded the Crimson Spider's immediate attention. But only silence answered her summoning cants. What else could preoccupy Claradore at this hour? Her thoughts touched the vast amount of gold and manpower required to man a Forge. The engine had to be extracted from the depths of the Underworld. 
Fresh corpses had be brought. There were few entities in the Known World who had access to a reliable supply of bodies. Moreover, under the reign of Ralens the Elder, the Known World has known twenty years of peace. Hence, only a state could 
operate the Forge. It could be the Medean Empire as Claradore would have known of it. Who else then? The Elysians? Why reveal such a weapon in a piecemeal manner? 
Any rational adversary would have used the monsters to flood the border forts. No, this enemy pinpointed her, a Magi and Nix had to learn how they identified her.

Nonetheless, Claradore would understand. No plan survived contact with the enemy's shield wall. Nix would venture in the beasts' den.

Her deer legs sprinted across the dark grass. By contrast running as a human now felt like walking. Rain clouds dissipated above leaving a full moon. The old Sarvitarian road zig zagged across fields of orchids and vineyards. Nix 
soared among plains and concrete, feeling as if her hooves shot out lightning bolts. This speed. She could have reached the far edges of the Known World in 
mere days had she wanted to.
The outline of Charov's Aqueduct soon unraveled behind hills.
The lights of the Palace Complex glittered across the Strait of Cyclonius. 
The Magrub Dogas banked towards the Exiles' Island, a prison in all but name for 
the purpleborn who had fallen out of favor with the Emperor. The fiends made turns around the island. One by one they landed, swallowed by the island's ominousness.

Nix vacated the deer's body. She unveiled her crimson wings, launching herself towards the creatures' lair.
