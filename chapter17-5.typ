She borrowed a deer's form and ran after the Magrub Dogas. The fell creatures 
seemed to ignore her as they flew in the direction of the imperial capital, still 
carrying Majorian's moaning body. His languish echoed through the night, guiding her towards what Nix assumed was the fiends' lair.

Under normal circumstances, Nix should have tried to summon Claradore's Artifice. The situation would have demanded the Crimson Spider's immediate attention. But only silence answered her summoning cants. What else could preoccupy Claradore at this hour? Her thoughts touched the vast amount of gold and manpower required to man a Forge. The engine had to be extracted from the depths of the Underworld. 
Fresh corpses had be brought. There were few entities in the Known World who had access to a reliable supply of bodies. Moreover, under the reign of Ralens the Elder, the Known World has known twenty years of peace. Hence, only a state could 
operate the Forge. It could be the Medean Empire as Claradore would have known of it. Who else then? The Elysians? Why reveal such a weapon in a piecemeal manner? 
Any rational adversary would have used the monsters to flood the border forts. No, this enemy pinpointed her, a Magi and Nix had to learn how they identified her.

Nonetheless, Claradore would understand. No plan survived contact with the enemy's shield wall. Nix would venture in the beasts' den.

Her deer legs sprinted across the dark grass. By contrast running as a human now felt like walking. Rain clouds dissipated above leaving a full moon. The old Sarvitarian road zig zagged across fields of orchids and vineyards. Nix 
soared among plains and concrete, feeling as if her hooves shot out lightning bolts. This speed. She could have reached the far edges of the Known World in 
mere days had she wanted to.
The outline of Charov's Aqueduct soon unraveled behind hills.
The lights of the Palace Complex glittered across the Strait of Cyclonius. 
The Magrub Dogas banked towards the Exiles' Island, a prison in all but name for 
the purpleborn who had fallen out of favor with the Emperor. The fiends made turns around the island. One by one they landed, swallowed by the island's ominousness.

Nix vacated the deer's body. She unveiled her crimson wings, launching herself towards the creatures' lair.

The smell of decomposed flesh permeated the air. Whatever malefic aura leaked from the Forge desecrated anything from bricks, marble and glass. Black ooze stained the walls. Nix did not dare to touch the substance. She could hear its 
breath. She could smell its mere presence that indicated the living rejected it.

Down the stairs, the snarl of creatures could have maddened anyone. Cries of rage,
sorrow and betrayal. Nix wondered if the fiends' human soul still clung to their corrupted vessel. That was a futile thought. One better left believing they were empty husks that needed deliverance. 

The steps led her to a hallway of cells. Half of them were filled with Magrub Dogas whose teeth were salivating as they stared at her. Nix braced for an imminent scream, a wail or any signal that would cause whatever guards there was 
to swarm her location. Instead, the Magrub Dogas' eyes continued to follow her behind their bars. She found vestiges of their lost humanity within their 
gaze, a mix of curiosity, indifference and fear. 
_At least they won't alarm any guards_ thought Nix.

"Where is my friend?" asked Nix. She waited. Five seconds. Ten seconds. 
Blue eyed, red eyed, green eyed stares. No answer. She was an idiot. It was obvious these creatures were incapable of speech.

The unpleasant news were that these ruins had become a labyrinth. Majorian's legs had been severed. Nix had to cauterize the wound at least. _Where are you, Majorian?_ thought Nix.

A man's voice rung through the hall. Boniface's voice. Nix muffled a laugh. Of course. Why had she not thought of it? The Faith had been responsible for this. 
The Faith who had rid the Known World of Magic now resorted to a Forge for the Goddess knew what. 

"There were three Magi to dispose of. None of our objectives were met," said Alexander's voice. Nix almost lost her balance. The Giant added another degree to her polynomial equation. She had just carved a bloody path through four Magrub Dogas hours earlier. Having to deal with another surprise was undesirable

"Then we forge more. The Magi are bound to crack under sheer numbers," said Boniface's voice.

"And where do you suggest we fetch corpses? Our Inquisitors can only do so much."

"The Elysian and Medean Empires stand at the brink of war. The boy king is respected by none."

"You assume we have the luxury of time, Disciple. The Magi know of the Forge's existence. They will come."

"Then I trust you will be able to shield us, Excellency."

"There is one more thing. The Creatures brought a live specimen for us this time."

Nix ran for the voices' position.

"What shall we do with it?"

"Mercy..." croaked Majorian's voice.

_Stay with me! Stay with me!_ thought Nix.

"The Forge accepts living ingredients. Throw him in," said Alexander.

"No, no, no, no, no!" screamed Nix as she barreled her way through the stone corridors and the hordes of imprisoned monsters.

Alexander's command ignited the sound of gears spinning and bellcranks grinding metal. A loud hiss reverberated through the ruins. Nix cursed, turning left, turning right. She had to save Majorian.

The thing called Majorian sang with a voice as elegant as it was frightening. This time, there was a duality of female and male voices in its vocal cords. 
Its intonation spoke of confusion and loss. Such was the beauty in the melody that Nix could have wept on the spot. That creature was an unholy miracle, capable of emulating all instruments in the Known World from water organs to harps.

"How unique...What to do with this one, your Excellency," asked Boniface.

"The Faith has no use for this mockery of a bard."

Alexander made a sudden turn of his head. Nix had no time to react. Their eyes met.

"So the Magi comes for their friend. Come little girl, do not be afraid."
