Nix has finished editing her fifth edict for this mundane day. Next two her, piles of proclamations, edicts, decrees, orders and answers to petitions were neatly sorted on Claradore's desk. She had spent the majority of the day battling the never-ending heaps of papers that had amassed on the study. It was an uphill battle, every foray into the pile yielding undiscovered sheets buried by disorganization. 

A musty wooden smell conjoined with a hypnotizing smell of heliotrope from the Magister Herboraum's cologne characterized Claradore's study. Nix had expected a different smell, a more unpleasant one due to the presence of paintings and marble statues depicting Claradore in the full grandiosity of his naked stature.

Sandals gifted by the less fortunate pointed towards the room's exit. Intricate networks of spider webs were found in all corners. Roaches, flies and ladybugs were trapped while spiders traveled in their domain undisturbed. The Grimoire of Red stood at the center of the room, the thousand pages tome beckoning a Magi to wield it once more. 

Instead of performing his duties, Claradore juggled three fire balls in his palms, leaving her to fight the beast that was his paperwork. 

"You wish to kill Boniface," said Claradore.

The Red Guild always studied their prey for weeks or even months before striking. 
The prey must wander into the web before springing the spider's talons. Care had to be taken so that fingers could not be pointed at the Red Guild easily. 

"You do not oppose it," said Nix.

"My approval is conditional," said Claradore.

Nix frowned. What ludicrous request he would ask her this time? The last 
favor he had spoken of required her to reserve the entirety of the Baths of 
Karakallus for his entourage or rather his imposing harem of male and female 
lovers. The patrician made a comical expression when Nix made the request,
struggling to keep a calm and composed face herself. 

Claradore smiled at her reaction. 
"There are two favors I wish of you, my dear. The first consists of 
attending the Elysian ball at Artazata. Foreign dignitaries will be there. I need you to gauge our neighbor's 
intentions."

Nix groaned. Of course, she had lost her medallion. Anyone who could open it would surely be there. However, Zhapur and Leila had assured her that her life could be in peril should anyone realize her mother's medallion was related to 
the late Empress Aishula. On another hand, it may be adequate to use the ball to acquire information on this Aishula person. Information was power and the Red Guild encouraged all of its members to gather whispers and rumors and bring them to the nest.

Nix already thought of the dress she would bring to the occasion. There was this 
fitted purple corset with tapered sleeves and cuffs adorned by filigree that the princess had commissionned but never bothered to wear. It sat sadly deep within 
Livia's wardrobe, hidden from plain sight.

"What about the second task?" asked Nix.

"I have concerns. The man called Sixtus should be feared."

"Is some manner of Giant?"

"You will have to confirm that, my dear."

“And how would you have me do that? You do not suppose he would simply 
identify himself.”

"The same way you have spied on Boniface, by taking another’s flesh as your own.”"

"Simple enough."

"There is an additional complexity. The skin I ask you to wear is… of a different sort."

"You cannot mean..."

"Of course, my dear. Humans are also animals."

"But the Magi..."

"The Magi are all dead."

Nix placed her two hands over her cheeks. Beasts never resisted her powers. Their minds were guided by primal urges such as hunger, thirst and survival. Simplicity was easy to manipulate. 
Humans on the other hand were uncharted territory for her invasion. But there was pleasure in the unknown. Magis seldom if not never dared to break their ancient rules. To be the first Magi in a millennium to venture into another human being's body was an adventure she could not refuse. How did it feel to glide into another's skin? Could she listen to their thoughts and fears? Could she utilize all of that newly gained information? Beneath the skin, there were no masks. All was visible to an intruder. Nix smiled. This could get interesting.

"Who am I to enter?" asked Nix.

"Is the princess not asleep at this hour?" said Claradore.

"You jest. I am to work my craft on the princess?"

"My dear. That is no different from you borrowing her clothes."

She scowled. "You have been spying on me!"

“Watching? No. Only bearing witness to the part the True Goddess has written for you. The Crown, my dear. You crave it still, do you not?”

Last time, Serena had asked that question and now Claradore. What did he expect as an answer? Who did not desire to wear the most resplendent clothing in the Known World? Anyone else would have answered positively. Alas, there were only 
two methods to sit on the throne of phoenix feathers. The first was to be a purple born. The other was to command an army and seize it through steel. Nix was unlucky to have neither of these.

Nix did not remember answering Claradore's question. She found herself standing before Livia's room. There were no Excubitores patrolling the premise 
at this specific minute. 
By gifting the locksmith a generous amount of gold, she has acquired a spare key to her favorite location in the entire palace. Her hands shook as she opened the door. 

The princess was sleeping on her bed. Nix melted her entire body. She let herself flow towards the bed, cascading on Livia's thighs, torso and neck. Nix found the nose and the mouth.

Amber glowed in her field of vision. She felt herself go through veins, arteries, a heart. Memories that were not hers passed through her head. They zipped through her consciousness as fast as a shooting star, not giving her any moment to capture them.  She witnessed dreams that were not hers, dreams about a marriage, about a baby boy, about world peace. Soon, toes wiggled at her command. Nix could lift fingers and arms. She ordered Livia's eyes to open.   

"It worked..." Nix said using Livia's voice.

She touched the waist, the arms, the legs, a wave of foreign sensitivity 
shaking her. Incredible. The combined touch of two humans was an experience to behold. She was a child again, rediscovering how touching an object felt.
Nix licked her lips, tasting the faint traces of ochre left on the princess' 
face.

She sauntered out of the bed, jumping with glee. Mucus ran from her or rather Livia's nose. She wiped it with a finger.

"It really worked! I...I can’t believe it! Oh! Baba! If only you could see this!"

She moved towards the mirror. Dishevelled black hair and a sweat soaked body greeted her red eyes. Red eyes. Red as the Medean phoenix. The complimented well her borrowed body.

"Salutations citizens, my name is Livia and I’m as the Goddess’ cunt!" said Nix. She ordered Livia's face to extend its tongue in a childish manner. From mischievous grins to devilish laughs, Livia's face made faces the real princess would have never thought of producing. 

Nix gravitated towards Livia's wardrobe and its garish gowns. Her eyes were now fixated on that hooded purple cloak that the late Empress Eudoxia once wore during her balls. It was still emblazoned with the Tiarmat hydra. Her fingers ran through the delicate fox hide that comprised the collar of the attire.

"I have always wanted this one," said Nix as her hands scurried to put on the cloak.

Turning to the mirror, her face snickered. The fabric clung close to her form, woven from deep, lustrous cloth that drinks the light like midnight silk. Fine embroidery, threads of gold and crimson shaped, traced the hems and bodice in diamond patterns.

If she could decorate Livia's face with the copious amount of makeup the princess
usually wore, Nix could probably make a goddess out of Livia. Foreign ambassadors
often spoke of the purple born as if they were angels descending from the Heavens.
When you smelled the purple born's unique flagrance brewed with such delicateness
and you saw the Emperor march down the throne's stairs, you would have believed it too. The purple born radiated this intimidating aura that was designed to 
disable one's ability to utter cogent arguments and words. 
The Empire had to demonstrate that its power derived from an otherworldly
source when in truth, denarii always prevailed.  

"See it does look better on me," said Nix as she swiveled around in Livia's purple cloak. Perhaps she would borrow this coat during winter.

"You truly have done it, my dear. How long can you hold?" said the Artifice.

"You doubt me?" said Nix. 

"That is not the point. There is a reason the Magi had crucified all the people who attempted this... I have seen it myself...The last execution of this kind of miscreant..."

"What are dead men’s rules to the living?"

"The blood mingles with one another, my dear...You should never lose sight of yourself."

"Always with the riddles...Has Baba ever told you how predictable you were?"

The Artifice bit an apple with its human lips. "My dear, even Baba could not possibly envision what you have just done. What are you going to do next?"

What was she going to achieve next? The task at hand would be to analyze 
the daily life of this Sixtus. But that would require another skin, one 
that she would have to pick carefully. Nix has never realized how warm a human body could be. No vessel was equal in this world despite all them being 
composed of bones, muscles, blood and other liquids. The one carrying Livia's soul 
commanded blind loyalty and was endowed with all the dresses, stolas, coats and 
togas Nix could dream of. Men feared it.
More importantly, Livia was hers to use. This opened an endless amount of possibilities. Perhaps. Perhaps she could also borrow this body for an extended period of time.  

"Why have we delayed in this matter?" asked Nix. "We might have bent even the Emperor to our will."

"My dear, unlike you, I am fond of my current form," said Claradore.

Nix heard a skin-pimpling screech inside hers no Livia's head. 
A migraine ravaged her inner thoughts. It was as if 
someone pounded at her skull's inner cavities. This vessel. It was aware that 
two souls now inhabited it. What a nuisance.

She placed a finger on her mouth. "Shhh. I just noticed. She can still hear us."

"My, my, so the spell has not been perfected yet. What a shame."

"She saw you."

A silence fell, heavy as an axe. The Artifice fed flies to cobwebs on the corner of the window. "Rest assured, my dear. No one will believe her, not even the Emperor himself."

"I’ll exit this, then. We have accomplished what we wanted."

Nix closed Livia's eyes. She felt her entire being flow away from the princess' inner organs. Soon, the sensations accompanying Livia's toes and fingers disappeared. Her blood regrouped at the princess' throat. She heard Livia wail 
in agony. _So that is how humans feel when Magi enter them_ thought Nix.
She shot herself from the princess' throat, her liquid flow streaming out of her 
former vessel's mouth.

What was this sadness that clung to her skin once the last droplet of blood had 
evacuated Livia's body? Has she grown fond of the warmth of being encased in this vessel? Nix sneered. There was after all a third way to sit on the Throne of Phoenix Feathers.
