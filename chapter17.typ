Nix knew she was being followed in her feline form. The large hooded man behind her 
towered over the crowd of humans that she tried to hide within. His inhuman eyes were riveted on every of her movements. She had to find a suitable place to return to her human form. 

The Cardinal knew. She reared her cat's head, meeting his emotionless stare. His knuckles were larger than her human face. To have unmasked her within seconds. As Claradore said earlier, that man was the embodiment of danger. 

Fight? For some reason, every sense, every bone, every organ in her body told her to disregard that idea. Somehow, her primordial urges knew that that man hunted Magi for 
sport. A Giant. A real Giant. A man whose footsteps made the soil tremble. She did not understand. All Giants perished alongside the Magi at the end of the Age of Magic. There were no tales of Giants living past their hundredth's summer.

_How? How is he alive?_ thought Nix.

She hastened her pace as she passed below Charov's Aqueduct, the young couples sharing a romantic evening paying no attention to her, nor her pursuer. Even Vigiles and Excubitores continued their usual routine, undisturbed by the monstrous specimen that walked the narrow streets. Like her, Alexander was accustomed to the art of camouflaging himself in the forest of humanity. After all, hiding in plain sight was always the preferred modus operanti for criminals and Magi alike.

Was he capable of wielding magic? This was a question Nix did not desire the answer to. Some Giants were sired by the Magi in the art of magic. None ever managed to perfect their art style. This deficiency was compensated by their raw strength. Their hands could grab a man's skull and crush it as easily as tissue. Combine that with even passable aptitude in the magical arts and Nix was unsure whether even Claradore would fancy duelling this beast of a man.

It was not her intention to allow Alexander to see her human form. The Palace Complex's five domes were visible in the distance.

Nix made a right turn. A dead end. She smiled. It was an advantage. A puzzle of climbable rocks presented itself before her. One by one, she used them to leap over the brick wall. 
_Finally, I have eluded him,_ thought Nix.

The cracking of bricks raised her feline hair. Alexander's hand smashed a hole through the wall. It shredded through the mortar as if it was papyrus. She started running again. Behind her, Alexander's unnatural face reappeared. 

"The Heavens be blessed. You are a Magi. They have granted me another opportunity to kill you," said Alexander in the Forgotten Tongue.

"How does a Giant still live in this age?" said Nix.

Alexander cracked his knuckles. His biceps swelled, rupturing his ill-fitting tunic.
"I am the one the books refer to as the Betrayer."

The Giant who betrayed his own kind to see the Goddess' Light because he was cursed with a lesser height. Nix was almost honored to set her eyes on his unique specimen.

"You fancy dirtying your hands for the Goddess. Why doesn't she come here herself?" said Nix.

"The Goddess has no time for insects such as you. I will suffice."

"She has time or she has abandoned you."

"Insolent roach! The Goddess loves me!"

Alexander's body had grown twice as large. Veins and muscles were the highlight of his new form, a grotesque parody of male physiology. Nix was glad that Claradore was not here. He could have been jealous.

_So he is prone to sensitive outbursts? Interesting_ thought Nix.

"Your Goddess' love is not unconditional. She does not love us Magi. And She does not love you."

"My life's work has been in Her name!"

"How sad. Your life's work makes Her vomit."

That last jest made Alexander thrust forwards, raising his fists in the air. Nix's blood weltered, forming a blade from her right arm. She moved sideways allowing his fist to connect with the wall behind her. Bricks and mortar shattered. Stones flew in the air. Nix slashed hoping she could hit his eyes. The Last Giant parried with his left hand. His flesh had the hardness of steel. Her blade refused to sink deeper as if it encountered an immovable fortress.

More blows came. Each of them striking concrete, amphoras or walls.
None could harm her. She threw flurry after flurry at his exposed torso. All 
hit a wall of impenetrable skin. Nix cursed.

"Coward! You fight without honor!" roared Alexander.

"Honor?" She spat the word like arsenic. "You make war upon a child."

"Silence! Your kind was supposed to be extinct!"

"I can say the same about yours."

"I am not a Giant. I am a Disciple of the Goddess!"

"Tell me, does your order require its servants to be mad?"

"The Slaver calls the Seeker of Truth delusional. What a mummer's farce!"

"Slaver?" Her eyes narrowed. "You Faithful have put an entire world in chains!"

"We broke their chains. We freed them from your Magi and your dark arts."

Nix did not wish to eternalize this stalemate. She took a deep breath. Her head, torso, legs and feet melted into a torrent of blood. Alexander screamed as she flowed around his arms and chest, feeling his heartbeat pulsating in a hectic manner. Her objective was his mouth and nose. Her liquefied form rushed to obstruct them. His hands trashed over her bloody form, unable to pry her away from his throat. 

It was then that she felt his throat bulge. A searing heat was building up, lighting 
his arteries and veins in a bronze hue. Nix disengaged, letting herself fall on the floor before reforming herself in a solid state. From Alexander's mouth, emerged fire.
His breath consumed concrete, plants, vases and glass alike, turning them into a canvass of cinders.
