Nix knew she was being followed in her feline form. The large hooded man behind her 
towered over the crowd of humans that she tried to hide within. His inhuman eyes were riveted on every of her movements. She had to find a suitable place to return to her human form. 

The Cardinal knew. She reared her cat's head, meeting his emotionless stare. His knuckles were larger than her human face. To have unmasked her within seconds. As Claradore said earlier, that man was the embodiment of danger. 

Fight? For some reason, every sense, every bone, every organ in her body told her to disregard that idea. Somehow, her primordial urges knew that that man hunted Magi for 
sport. A Giant. A real Giant. A man whose footsteps made the soil tremble. She did not understand. All Giants perished alongside the Magi at the end of the Age of Magic. There were no tales of Giants living past their hundredth's summer.

_How? How is he alive?_ thought Nix.

She hastened her pace as she passed below Charov's Aqueduct, the young couples sharing a romantic evening paying no attention to her, nor her pursuer. Even Vigiles and Excubitores continued their usual routine, undisturbed by the monstrous specimen that walked the narrow streets. Like her, Alexander was accustomed to the art of camouflaging himself in the forest of humanity. After all, hiding in plain sight was always the preferred modus operanti for criminals and Magi alike.

Was he capable of wielding magic? This was a question Nix did not desire the answer to. Some Giants were sired by the Magi in the art of magic. None ever managed to perfect their art style. This deficiency was compensated by their raw strength. Their hands could grab a man's skull and crush it as easily as tissue. Combine that with even passable aptitude in the magical arts and Nix was unsure whether even Claradore would fancy duelling this beast of a man.

It was not her intention to allow Alexander to see her human form. The Palace Complex's five domes were visible in the distance.

Nix made a right turn. A dead end. She smiled. It was an advantage. A puzzle of climbable rocks presented itself before her. One by one, she used them to leap over the brick wall. 
_Finally, I have eluded him,_ thought Nix.

The cracking of bricks raised her feline hair. Alexander's hand smashed a hole through the wall. It shredded through the mortar as if it was papyrus. She started running again. Behind her, Alexander's unnatural face reappeared.
