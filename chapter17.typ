Nix knew she was being followed in her feline form. The large hooded man behind her 
towered over the crowd of humans that she tried to hide within. His inhuman eyes were riveted on every of her movements. She had to find a suitable place to return to her human form. 

The Cardinal knew. She reared her cat's head, meeting his emotionless stare. His knuckles were larger than her human face. To have unmasked her within seconds. As Claradore said earlier, that man was the embodiment of danger. 

Fight? For some reason, every sense, every bone, every organ in her body told her to disregard that idea. Somehow, her primordial urges knew that that man hunted Magi for 
sport. A Giant. A real Giant. A man whose footsteps made the soil tremble. She did not understand. All Giants perished alongside the Magi at the end of the Age of Magic. There were no tales of Giants living past their hundredth's summer.

_How? How is he alive?_ thought Nix.

She hastened her pace as she passed below Charov's Aqueduct, the young couples sharing a romantic evening paying no attention to her, nor her pursuer. Even Vigiles and Excubitores continued their usual routine, undisturbed by the monstrous specimen that walked the narrow streets. Like her, Alexander was accustomed to the art of camouflaging himself in the forest of humanity. After all, hiding in plain sight was always the preferred modus operanti for criminals and Magi alike.

Was he capable of wielding magic? This was a question Nix did not desire the answer to. Some Giants were sired by the Magi in the art of magic. None ever managed to perfect their art style. This deficiency was compensated by their raw strength. Their hands could grab a man's skull and crush it as easily as tissue. Combine that with even passable aptitude in the magical arts and Nix was unsure whether even Claradore would fancy duelling this beast of a man.

It was not her intention to allow Alexander to see her human form. The Palace Complex's five domes were visible in the distance.

Nix made a right turn. A dead end. She smiled. It was an advantage. A puzzle of climbable rocks presented itself before her. One by one, she used them to leap over the brick wall. 
_Finally, I have eluded him,_ thought Nix.

She found herself in a cemetery dating from the Plague of Anastasian. Tombstones with inscriptions in both the Classical and the Tongue littered the grounds, swallowed by the Palace Complex's shadow. Nix scoured left and right. There was not a single animal nor man in sight.  

The cracking of bricks raised her feline hair. Alexander's hand smashed a hole through the wall. It shredded through the mortar as if it was papyrus. She started running again. Behind her, Alexander's unnatural face reappeared. 

"The Heavens be blessed. You are a Magi. They have granted me another opportunity to kill you lot," said Alexander in the Forgotten Tongue.

Nix chose to exit the cat's body. She emerged, watching the Cardinal observe her reconstitute herself with his aged eyes.

"How does a Giant still live in this age?" said Nix.

Alexander cracked his knuckles. His biceps swelled, rupturing his ill-fitting tunic.
"I am the one the books refer to as the Betrayer."

The Giant who betrayed his own kind to see the Goddess' Light because he was cursed with a lesser height. Nix was almost honored to set her eyes on his unique specimen.

"You fancy dirtying your hands for the Goddess. Why doesn't she come here herself?" said Nix.

"The Goddess has no time for insects such as you. I will suffice."

"She has time or she has abandoned you."

"Insolent roach! The Goddess loves me!"

Alexander's body had grown twice as large. Veins and muscles were the highlight of his new form, a grotesque parody of male physiology. Nix was glad that Claradore was not here. He could have been jealous.

_So he is prone to sensitive outbursts? Interesting_ thought Nix.

"Your Goddess' love is not unconditional. She does not love us Magi. And She does not love you."

"My life's work has been in Her name!"

"How sad. Your life's work makes Her vomit."

That last jest made Alexander thrust forwards, raising his fists in the air. Nix's blood weltered, forming a blade from her right arm. She moved sideways allowing his fist to connect with the wall behind her. Bricks and mortar shattered. Stones flew in the air. Nix slashed hoping she could hit his eyes. The Last Giant parried with his left hand. His flesh had the hardness of steel. Her blade refused to sink deeper as if it encountered an immovable fortress.

More blows came. Each of them striking concrete, amphoras or walls.
None could harm her. She threw flurry after flurry at his exposed torso. All 
hit a wall of impenetrable skin. Nix cursed.

"Coward! You fight without honor!" roared Alexander.

"Honor?" She spat the word like arsenic. "You make war upon a child."

"Silence! Your kind was supposed to be extinct!"

"I can say the same about yours."

"I am not a Giant. I am a Disciple of the Goddess!"

"Tell me, does your order require its servants to be mad?"

"The Slaver calls the Seeker of Truth delusional. What a mummer's farce!"

"Slaver?" Her eyes narrowed. "You Faithful have put an entire world in chains!"

"We broke their chains. We freed them from your Magi and your dark arts."

"And stripped them from the Magi's knowledge. Centuries of human progress were wiped you!"


Nix did not wish to eternalize this stalemate. She took a deep breath. Her head, torso, legs and feet melted into a torrent of blood. Alexander screamed as she flowed around his arms and chest, feeling his heartbeat pulsating in a hectic manner. Her objective was his mouth and nose. Her liquefied form rushed to obstruct them. His hands trashed over her bloody form, unable to pry her away from his throat. 

It was then that she felt his throat bulge. A searing heat was building up, lighting 
his arteries and veins in a bronze hue. Nix disengaged, letting herself fall on the floor before reforming herself in a solid state. From Alexander's mouth, emerged fire.
His breath consumed concrete, plants, vases and glass alike, turning them into a canvass of cinders.

Was this how the Magi of old danced with dragons? Sensing their scalding breath pass near your skin hastened her heartbeat to delirious levels. Nix jumped in the air dodging stream after stream. She molded spears with her arms. Her opponent has shown that he has little to no weaknesses. But he has the unfortunate curse of being a man. Every man possesses that one weak spot that all women were told to take advantage of when in grave peril.

She thrusted downwards aiming for his genitals. Alexander seemed to have deduced her intentions as he braced his arms, covering his soft spot. _Predictable,_ thought Nix.
Her bloody spear pressed towards her enemy's visage. She struck one eyeball. Alexander roared in pain. Disengage of press on? She had the advantage and must utilize it to its fullest. The second spear fell down, striking one of his arms. Nix saw too late the scarlet glow emanating from Alexander's throat. A scorching blaze engulfed her abdomen, throat and face. Hair burned. The smell of roasted flesh and blood flooded her senses.

Nix yelled, rolling on the cemetary's ground. Baba's tales told the stories of men who preferred to fall on their sword rather than endure the sensation of burning flesh. Her lungs seared. It felt as if there were a million ants clawing and eating at her eyes, skin, lips, ears, arms, fingers and tendons.

Behind her, Alexander approached.

"Wicked wench, you took my eye," rasped the Cardinal.

_Your new look suits you well,_ thought Nix.

His massive hands grabbed her by the hair. She screamed in agony. 

"How many Magi are there, witch?" asked Alexander.

She still had the strength to spit at him, her saliva was coated in calcined blood.

"Still defiant, aren't we? We will not be once the Inquisitors arrive," said Alexander.

He started dragging her through mud before stopping momentarily. Her captor gazed at the full moon. He swore. A whistling sound perforated the air. A pillar of light crashed down. Alexander released her to evade the attack. A second pillar light rained down from the Heavens. For a few seconds, Nix has forgotten her burning body. She wanted to laugh. The number of known Magi in the Known World has now doubled.

"You now side with Magi? Have you been consumed by madness?" said Alexander.

Nix's savior answered with another pillar of right. It plummeted on Alexander' spine. 
The Cardinal shrieked in pain. It was now his turn to feel his flesh being eaten by flames. The pillar of light displaced dust and stones alike. Flying debris buffeted Nix.

"You shall depart from this city forthwith, Disciple," thundered a voice from the heavens.

"You fled from your defeats, and yet fate has delivered you back into my hands," declared Alexander.

"The failures I have made were induced by you." 

Alexander chortled. "A thousand years of banishment, and still you have learned nothing of consequence."

"You and I were never meant to rule, Alexander." 

A being with white swan wings descended from the sky. An angel? A woman? 
Her plumage could have made moonlight a second sun. It brightened the starless night, 
inundating the cemetery in overwhelming light. Nix did not care if she would become blind from witnessing such a miracle. In the history of the Known World, only one being could radiate as majestically as this one. 

The figure levitated in the air, slowly losing altitude. Cardinal Alexander uttered a litany of profanities at it. Soon, the entity's visage would be visible. Nix was curious to see it, a face that all of the Faithful's paintings and sculptures struggled to recreate. A smile she knew all too well was the first thing that the figure showed her. Nix would have gasped if blisters had not consumed her lips. For Serena has appeared.
