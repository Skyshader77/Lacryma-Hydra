Nix has finished editing her fifth edict for this mundane day. Next two her, piles of proclamations, edicts, decrees, orders and answers to petitions were neatly sorted on Claradore's desk. She had spent the majority of the day battling the never-ending heaps of papers that had amassed on the study. It was an uphill battle, every foray into the pile yielding undiscovered sheets buried by disorganization. 


A musty wooden smell conjoined with a hypnotizing smell of heliotrope from the Magister Herboraum's cologne characterized Claradore's study. Nix had expected a different smell, a more unpleasant one due to the presence of paintings and marble statues depicting Claradore in the full grandiosity of his naked stature.

Sandals gifted by the less fortunate pointed towards the room's exit. Intricate networks of spider webs were found in all corners. Roaches, flies and ladybugs were trapped while spiders traveled in their domain undisturbed. The Grimoire of Red stood at the center of the room, the thousand pages tome beckoning a Magi to wield it once more. 

Instead of performing his duties, Claradore juggled three fire balls in his palms, leaving her to fight the beast that was his paperwork. 

"You wish to kill Boniface," said Claradore.

The Red Guild always studied their prey for weeks or even months before striking. 
The prey must wander into the web before springing the spider's talons. Care had to be taken so that fingers could not be pointed at the Red Guild easily. 

"You do not oppose it," said Nix.

"I have concerns. The man called Alexander should be feared."

"Is he a Giant?"

"You will have to confirm that, my dear."

"How?"

"The same way you have spied on Boniface. However, there is another skin you may wear for your gathering of whispers."

"You cannot mean..."

"Of course, my dear. Humans are also animals."

"But the Magi..."

"The Magi are all dead."

Nix placed her two hands over her cheeks. Beasts never resisted her powers. Their minds were guided by primal urges such as hunger, thirst and survival. Simplicity was easy to manipulate. 
Humans on the other hand were uncharted territory for her invasion. But there was pleasure in the unknown. Magis seldom if not never dared to break their ancient rules. To be the first Magi in a millennium to venture into another human being's body was an adventure she could not refuse. How did it feel to glide into another's skin? Could she listen to their thoughts and fears? Could she utilize all of that newly gained information? Beneath the skin, there were no masks. All was visible to an intruder. Nix smiled. This could get interesting.

"Who am I to enter?" asked Nix.

"Is the princess not asleep at this hour?" said Claradore.

"You jest. I am to use magic on the princess?"

"My dear. That is no different from you borrowing her clothes."

She scowled. "You have been spying on me!"

"I was simply confirming the role the True Goddess assigned to you, my dear. The Crown. You want it, do you not?"

Last time, Serena had asked that question and now Claradore. What did he expect as an answer? Who did not desire to wear the most resplendent clothing in the Known World? Anyone else would have answered positively. Alas, there were only 
two methods to sit on the throne of phoenix feathers. The first was to be a purple born. The other was to command an army and seize it through steel. Nix was unlucky to have neither of these.

Nix found herself standing before Livia's room. By gifting the locksmith a generous amount of gold, she has acquired a spare key to her favorite location in the entire palace. Her hands shook as she opened the door. 

The princess was sleeping on her bed. Nix melted her entire body. She let herself flow towards the bed, cascading on Livia's thighs, torso and neck. Nix found the nose and the mouth.

Amber glowed in her field of vision. She felt herself go through veins, arteries, a heart. Memories that were not hers passed through her head. They zipped through her consciousness as fast as a shooting star, not giving her any moment to capture them.  She witnessed dreams that were not hers, dreams about a marriage, about a baby boy, about world peace. Soon, toes wiggled at her command. Nix could lift fingers and arms. She ordered Livia's eyes to open.   

"It worked..." Nix said using Livia's voice.

She sauntered out of the bed, jumping with glee. Mucus ran from her nose. She wiped it with a finger.

"It really worked! I...I can’t believe it! Oh! Baba! If only you could see this!"

She moved towards the mirror. Dishevelled black hair and a sweat soaked body greeted her red eyes. Red eyes. Red as the Medean phoenix. The complimented well her borrowed body.

"Salutations citizens, my name is Livia and I’m as the Goddess’ cunt!" said Nix. She ordered Livia's face to extend its tongue in a childish manner. From mischievous grins to devilish laughs, Livia's face made faces the real princess would have never thought of producing. 

Nix gravitated towards Livia's wardrobe. Her eyes were now fixated on that purple cloak that the late Empress Eudoxia once wore during her balls. It was still emblazoned with the Tiarmat hydra. Her fingers ran through the delicate fox hide that comprised the collar of the attire.

"I have always wanted this one," said Nix as her hands scurried to put on the cloak.

Turning to the mirror, her face snickered.

"See it does look better on me."

"You truly have done it, my dear. How long can you hold?" said the monstrosity.

"You doubt me?" said Nix.

"That is not the point. There is a reason the Magi had crucified all the people who attempted this... I have seen it myself...The last execution of this kind of miscreant..."

"What are dead men’s rules to the living?"

"The blood mingles with one another, my dear...You should never lose sight of yourself."

"Always with the riddles...Has Baba ever told you how predictable you were?"

The Artifice bit an apple with its human lips. "My dear, even Baba could not possibly envision what you have just done. What are you going to do next?"

Her body placed a finger on her mouth. "Shhh. I just noticed. She can still hear us."

"My my, so the spell has not been perfected yet. What a shame."

"She saw you."

The Artifice fed flies to cobblewebs on the corner of the window. "Rest assured, my dear. No one will believe her, not even the Emperor himself."

"I’ll exit this, then. We have accomplished what we wanted."
