"Why were you meeting the alchemists?" Domitian asked. His breath reeked of alcohol. Lipstick lingered on his neck coated with sweat. How her old self was not privy to this was beyond her understanding. At least the revelation made her decision all the easier.

"The pyromancers offered a fire show for our wedding. They wished to demonstrate their talents," lied Livia.

Domitian squinted his eyes. He was not as idiotic as she had thought. "I thought you did not fancy fire. Your uncle..."

"Many summers and winters have passed since then."

As a child, her old self had seen the pretender Phokas be doused by Medean Fire. The man had wailed as he rolled on the marble floor. She had been mortified then, the vision of embers licking his eyes and tongue, his roars of agony haunted her nightmares during her tenth summer.

"My love, how fares your health?" Domitian asked, apprehension in his eyes. 
_So he suspects,_ thought Livia.

"I have never felt such vigor, my love," said Livia. She tried best to convey pretend affection in the intonation of my love. He smiled, opening his arms for 
an embrace. Where were the hired blades she had paid the day before? Livia with great reluctance entered his arms. He locked her in his arms. She cursed silently. What brutish strength! She swore he could have severed her rib cage with such force. Livia could not breathe. In fact, his crushing arms almost expelled Nix from her body.

"You are hurting me, you simpleton!" she croaked.

Domitian released her. Wide terrified eyes greeted hers.

"Livia...I do not understand."

She tired of this conversation. Livia masked her satisfaction upon hearing footsteps approaching her location. They came from both sides of the tunnel. Men dressed in the way of the Men of the Crucible surrounded them. The Excubitores unsheathed their steel. Domitian snarled.

"What is the meaning of this!" said Livia. She turned towards Domitian, her visage making a perfect imitation of fear.

"You have done no wrong, little birds. Do not think this is personal," said one of the men with a thick Elysian accent. Daggers flashed beneath their white tunics.

"Stay behind me, my love!" screamed Domitian. 

The bulk of the assassins went for Domitian and his two household guards. Livia had ensured the bounty for his head dwarfed the one for hers. Around her, the Excubitores flailed their steel weapons. Livia shrieked, calling for help. Blood was spilled. Some of her would be assassins fell down the cold floor. One of them 
managed to penetrate the Excubitores' perimeter. Livia revealed her concealed dagger. This body was not as honed in dancing as her previous one. The thrust narrowly missed her shoulder by an inch, She slashed. Fingers fell on the floor.

The man yelled a horrible sound as he curled himself in a fetal position. In front of her, Domitian laid, clutching his entrails. His visage was pale. Livia ran to him. To her surprise, he had slain all eight of the men who took his life.

"Livia..." he croaked. She mustered whatever crocodile tears she could.

"Save your breath for the Gates of the Underworld, scum," she whispered into his ears. He closed his eyes, never to open them again. She clenched his arms, crying out his name. Livia gave her small audience a stunning performance on grief. Melodrama had to be shown here. She chose her words carefully, quoting the greatest tragedies from the Age of Magic. All present had to see a mourning girl, distressed by the unfolding dance of knives. 


An Excubitore pointed their sword at his throat.

"Your August Majesty, we should interrogate this fiend. Answer me! Who sent you?"
said the Excubitore.

"It is no use to speak to such men. The evidence is bare for all to see. Cardinal Alexander sent these men. Kill them. Kill them all," hissed Livia.
