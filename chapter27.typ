When Livia first heard about the Empire's caches of Medean Fire, she had overheard Claradore inquiring about their condition. Livia had imagined a few dozen barrels or amphoraes lingering in a subterranean den, accumulating mold while rats or roaches sipped the leaking liquid. Never did she think the crates or amphoraes could fill the entirety of a cistern. She almost dropped the shrimp dumpling she was savoring.

A mix of oil and sulfur permeated the underground air. Pyromancers and alchemists dressed in their iconic black robes and dragon shaped masks that prevented them from inhaling the toxic fumes. Livia of course had been gifted one of these masks. How anyone could see through the two minuscule holes was beyond her comprehension? It was no surprise that the pyromancers and alchemists always collided with mules, donkeys and carts on the streets of Thanatopolis.

She observed the frescoes depicting the Goddess spouting fire at Elysian soldiers. Other mosaics hearkened to the pyromancers' previous uses for the Empire. The mosaics showed flames licking the toes and fingers of prisoners. That was of course before the recipe for Medean Fire had been generated.   

"My Lady has taken an interest in our craft, it seems," said the Magister Ignis, the eunuch Sotober. The one-eyed man's head only reached her elbow, a consequence of his own mother throwing him into a well after childbirth. 

"Magisters and Cardinals are vanishing one after the other. The court begins whispering. They need to be reassured," said Livia.

"I hear monsters roam the surroundings. Are any of it true?"

"The crown is investigating all sorts of matters. What can you tell me about your capabilities, Magister Ignis?"

Sotober twisted his lips. "We have enough fire to make the Palace Complex into a volcano, your August Majesty."

A non magical way of matching the most potent of the Magi's spells. Livia did not want to admit it, but the non Magi had impressed her. Even the alchemists' own secrecy was second to none. The recipe was passed down from son to father. Medean Emperors were forbidden to know the contents.

"Would you love watching a volcano, Lord Sotober?" said Livia.

"My Lady asks a philosophical question. There is not a single pyromancer who is not a pyromaniac. Your ancestors had denied us the right to use the Flames on the Molochian Hordes."

"The Walls of Thanatopolis had stood strong. If you desire to watch an eruption, you will transport a number of amphoraes for me. You will only move them at night. Ships will be provided. No word of this must reach the Emperor nor the Magister Militums."

A flicker of curiosity lit Sotober's face. 
"My Lady has a destination in mind?"

Livia knew exactly where she would send the amphoraes to.

In the latrines, she stared at her own hand, one that was now incapable of liquefying. Becoming royalty had come with a price or had it? Claradore had cautioned her against using magic in her new vessel. Why she had asked? She only received the vaguest of answers from the Artifice. Yet the sensation of being a Magi perdured. It craved to be released again. 

She recited a cant as she slowed her breathing. Livia could not let herself be defenseless. In the most optimistic of scenarios, she would let the Excubitores shield her from danger. In the most pessimistic of scenarios, she would slay all witnesses. _I am a Magi,_ she thought. Two imperial bloodlines coursed through her veins. She would not be denied her birthright.

Livia snapped her fingers. Nothing. She snapped again. Still nothing. 
Yet, all elements of her body believed magic to be possible. She closed her eyes, hearing her own heartbeat. 

Again.

Her thumb made contact with her index finger. A spark. A tiny flame. It danced on her fingertip. It was the very first spell she had learned at Baba's House. Livia grinned. 

"Why were you meeting the alchemists?" Domitian asked. His breath reeked of alcohol. Lipstick lingered on his neck coated with sweat. How her old self was not privy to this was beyond her understanding. At least the revelation made her decision all the easier.

"The pyromancers offered a fire show for our wedding. They wished to demonstrate their talents," lied Livia.

Domitian squinted his eyes. He was not as idiotic as she had thought. "I thought you did not fancy fire. Your uncle..."

"Many summers and winters have passed since then."

As a child, her old self had seen the pretender Phokas be doused by Medean Fire. The man had wailed as he rolled on the marble floor. She had been mortified then, the vision of embers licking his eyes and tongue, his roars of agony haunted her nightmares during her tenth summer.

"My love, how fares your health?" Domitian asked, apprehension in his eyes. 
_So he suspects,_ thought Livia.

"I have never felt such vigor, my love," said Livia. She tried best to convey pretend affection in the intonation of my love. He smiled, opening his arms for 
an embrace. Where were the hired blades she had paid the day before? Livia with great reluctance entered his arms. He locked her in his arms. She cursed silently. What brutish strength! She swore he could have severed her rib cage with such force. Livia could not breathe. In fact, his crushing arms almost expelled Nix from her body.

"You are hurting me, you simpleton!" she croaked.

Domitian released her. Wide terrified eyes greeted hers.

"Livia...I do not understand."

She tired of this conversation. Livia masked her satisfaction upon hearing footsteps approaching her location. They came from both sides of the tunnel. Men dressed in the way of the Men of the Crucible surrounded them. The Excubitores unsheathed their steel. Domitian snarled.

"What is the meaning of this!" said Livia. She turned towards Domitian, her visage making a perfect imitation of fear.

"You have done no wrong, little birds. Do not think this is personal," said one of the men with a thick Elysian accent. Daggers flashed beneath their white tunics.

"Stay behind me, my love!" screamed Domitian. 

The bulk of the assassins went for Domitian and his two household guards. Livia had ensured the bounty for his head dwarfed the one for hers. Around her, the Excubitores flailed their steel weapons. Livia shrieked, calling for help. Blood was spilled. Some of her would be assassins fell down the cold floor. One of them 
managed to penetrate the Excubitores' perimeter. Livia revealed her concealed dagger. This body was not as honed in dancing as her previous one. The thrust narrowly missed her shoulder by an inch, She slashed. Fingers fell on the floor.

The man yelled a horrible sound as he curled himself in a fetal position. In front of her, Domitian laid, clutching his entrails. His visage was pale. Livia ran to him. To her surprise, he had slain all eight of the men who took his life.

"Livia..." he croaked. She mustered whatever crocodile tears she could.

"Save your breath for the Gates of the Underworld, scum," she whispered into his ears. He closed his eyes, never to open them again. She clenched his arms, crying out his name. Livia gave her small audience a stunning performance on grief. Melodrama had to be shown here. She chose her words carefully, quoting the greatest tragedies from the Age of Magic. All present had to see a mourning girl, distressed by the unfolding dance of knives. 


An Excubitore pointed their sword at his throat.

"Your August Majesty, we should interrogate this fiend. Answer me! Who sent you?"
said the Excubitore.

"It is no use to speak to such men. The evidence is bare for all to see. Cardinal Alexander sent these men. Kill them. Kill them all," hissed Livia.
