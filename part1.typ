= Baba: Year 1021 Imperial Age <baba-year-1021-imperial-age>
== Nix <ch:Nix01>
A finger could be a harpoon. Thinking about it that way gave the Faith an aneurysm. Nix knew that much. Yet the Faith seldom showed their white cloaks around Baba’s abode. Baba claimed that was a good thing, thought Nix as her index finger melted, taking the color of blood. What would the Faithful say if they saw what her and Baba did every day.

#emph[Lance.] She felt her blood twirl, reshaping itself.

"The blood is the quill. The body is the canvas," once said Baba the first time Nix had tried it. Had she been four or five summers when Baba noticed it? Not that it mattered now.

She concentrated. Her blood tickled as it extended again and again. This tingling sensation that she could never part with...It drove her to heightened plane, one she had hoped more people could understand. The red filaments spliced from her fingers similar to a paint stroke. #emph[Beautiful.] Helices, foliums, butterflies. They espoused every form her mind commanded. Nix felt it. Touching the air and feeling its warmth and dampness. Air was made of water. What took the Faith hundreds of years to accept had been discovered by the Magi during the Age of Magic, Baba’s funniest story. Nix laughed, causing the filaments to vibrate in a hectic manner.

#emph[Stop.]

The filaments froze. She took a heavy breath. Slowly, her blood consolidated, the air becoming less palpable. She could no longer feel the water within it. Filaments which had been watery a few seconds ago were now as thick and solid as wood. Entwined with each other, they formed a tip, the same she had imagined when reading the tale of Regnant the Dragonslayer whose spear had pierced The Last Dragon. In her case, her finger was the lance. She brandished it high in the air, yelling from the top of her small lungs.

"Behold! The Lance of True Redemption," she yelled. Her high pitched voice making a poor imitation of what Regnant’s voice would have sounded a millennium ago. The crows perched on the tree next to her vacated their perch on the spot. A squirrel ran between her legs, chased by a ravenous fox. Her remaining audience, a pair of the ugliest toads she had ever seen croaked roughly. In her mind, they were applauding as they always had. #emph[Drats! Too loud!] She bowed before the two amphibians, pretending to collect tips.

"Do not fear, ladies and gentlemen as the show has merely started. And now for the encore!"

With her bloody spear, she struck at the stream she visited every week. Orange bellied salmon, blue mackerels and black dotted trouts. Baba had five recipes for each type of fish found in the river. Today, Nix’ interest was not in any of those but the large catfish she had been stalking for the past week. It had gained a feet since she last saw it. Just thinking about broiling it on Baba’s pan made her salivate. Nix already imagined its tender flesh roasting with ginger, thymes and black pepper being deposited on her hungry tongue.

Her finger had missed. She cursed. Baba would have slapped her wrist. She swore in the Imperial Tongue instead, Baba saying it was more acceptable than in the Classical Tongue.

She attacked the waters again. Another miss, the clearing’s quietude now perturbed by her screams and water splashing. Seconds, minutes passed, her nemesis dodging her every attempt to harpoon it. Nix never thought a fish’s brain could allow it to be so nimble. #emph[I need more.] Plunging it underwater, her right hand’s index finger now liquified. Its blood spun. Salt, small traces. She could touch it within the water molecules. It was the exact same texture as the one Baba used to season her plates. The filaments tied themselves to create another lance.

Nix smiled. She struck with the first lance. The fish dodged. Her second spear struck. She felt it. Blood and flesh on her fingers. Nix pulled her finger out of the water, the catfish’s body dangling from her harpoon. Her blood twirled again, hauling her prize back to the river’s banks. The catfish was brought to her arms, still flailing in a helpless manner. Nix took a whiff of it. Seawater, a taste she had the pleasure of masking with Baba’s spice collection.

Something tugged at her dress. Of all the animals she had come to know through her eleventh summer in the Known World, a bear cub was one of the most adorable. They were both of the same height and its brown eyes screamed pity.

"Are you not a cute one? I’m really sorry but this fish is for Baba and I... I can catch you a salmon if you want, little bear."

The bear sniffed at the catfish, widening its eyes akin to a young puppy. #emph[No, no, no, not for you!] She raised the catfish high in the air, causing the cub to whimper.

She started walking, the cub insisting on following her.

"No, stay. Stay! I can’t bring you home!" she said. The bear kept walking at the same pace as her.

A threatening roar behind her paralyzed her. One which dominated the forest. One which instilled fear upon her primordial senses. The legend Baba had told her spoke of the Men of Old who hunted giant versions of these beasts, one strike for their claws being enough to kill an adult. Nix had drawn a few of them after the scary bedtime stories. They had always been black with crimson eyes, oozing maleficence. Sometimes, she even gave them wings to make them as terrifying as the dragons she often confused them with. Nix wet herself. Her mind chastised her for her stupidity. She should have known. She should have known. Baba would scold her without remorse. Run. Run. The only option was to run.

She had never bolted as fast as she did, catfish in hands. The creature behind her bellowed, its ghastly cries echoing ever closer. Deers, pigeons and insects fled before her path. An earthquake seemed to rumble before her, its tremors approaching. Deafening wakes erupted in the river. Nix knew it outswam and outran her. Yet, her legs disobeyed her soul at this very moment. She could smell it, its animalist rage imbued with a desire to protect something dear to it just as Baba would shield her from any harm. #emph[The luck that cub has.]

The path back to Baba’s house now looked long and infinite. She could sense the thing’s raucous breath behind her. A tree. It could not climb trees. The second bright idea her brain could think of today. She barreled her way to the top of a tree, her catfish thrown at the roots. All those years at climbing the Hollow Tree next to Baba’s house paid off after all. Nix perched herself atop a branch, watching her pursuer, this mass of brown and reddish fur with claws as sharp as shark’s teeth. Its stench as unbearable. Feces mixed with fish and a faint trace of wildberries. It growled at her with utmost contempt. Baba had once told her that humans were the most feared species on this world. By seeing this monster, Nix realized that mankind was a terrible liar.

It circled the tree, snarling and grunting. In Baba’s stories, humans had always been the hunters not the hunted. That never made any sense to her. Humans were but bugs to the thing that pursued her. Her ancestors would have been displeased. Only the Goddess was aware if it was cursed with the fatal rage, the same possession that afflicted the deer Baba ended a year ago. They were not allowed to eat these fallen animals. The demon could jump hosts as Baba explained to her. All one could do was burn the husk.

She wanted to cry, curling herself into a ball. It started to get cold. She should have brought the new cloak Baba made for her on her birthday. What if she could not return? Would Baba go look for her? Would her puppy, Spartak, still wait for her at the doorstep? It still cried each time she shut the toilet door in front of it. Her bowels also screamed at her to relieve them. #emph[Just take the fish and leave me alone! I want to go home.] She spat at the colossal monster, not even inconveniencing it in the slightest. She dared not imagine Baba’s fury should she return past her curfew time.

Her bowels beckoned again. An idea Baba would have scolded her for hit her. Raising her tunic, she peed from the branch she sat on, ensuring the stream would trickle down on her adversary’s fur. #emph[How do like that, spawn of the Brood Mother?] If she was to depart from the Goddess’ land today, she would at least make Baba proud of her struggle. The monster sniffed its own skin, growling in disgust. It clawed at her tree, unable to reach her position. Nix’ tears of worry became tears of joy.

The creature seemed to listen to her or rather it grew tired of her whimpering before retreating. It emitted a nonchalant growl. She listened to each of its heavy steps. Only when she could no longer smell its foul odor nor hear other animals fleeing its might did she climb down her tree. #emph[Bless the Goddess!] Nix breathed a sigh of relief.

The sun had begun to set, painting the forest in an orange hue. Nix walked akin to a revenant home, the owls and cardinals not chirping back at her today. On other days, she would frolic like the heroes she read about in fairy tales, chanting with the robins and frogs she encountered. Once, she had even kissed a frog, hoping to get a prince out of it. The next day, her lips had swollen to a comical degree. Baba had slapped her own forehead when Nix had told her the frog’s color, forbidding her to touch any bright colored amphibian in the future.

Her feet kicked a few pebbles on the trail which still at some occasions showed the name of the Sarvitarian engineer or governor who helped maintain it. It had been useful to learn the Imperial Tongue.

"Baba, why do I have to learn two languages?" Nix had asked.

"The Classical Tongue is for the civilized and the Imperial Tongue is for the uneducated ," Baba had replied.

Smoke rose from Baba’s hut. Not so far away laid the village of Miroconium where Baba bought her books and where all the people her age lived. And further away were the two cities of Thanatopolis and Metarexia, places where one could contemplate their smallness according to Baba. The princesses and princes she had heard from in fairy tales lived there. Them, their beautiful costumes and the adventures the songwriters and poets wrote about in abundance.

"Baba, can I go there when I am older?" Nix had asked.

Baba would hug her with a smell reminiscent of home. Why Nix could not address her as Mother was beyond her. Baba would then open the encyclopedia the Sarvitarian Empire wrote on Thanatopolis during its rejuvenation, detailing with lavish hand drawings the monuments and landmarks from the Hippodrome to the Palace Complex. Why could Baba and she not live in this city was beyond her as well?

"I am too old to live next to emperors and empresses. Handling one in my home was enough for me," said Baba.

"But Baba, doesn’t the Emperor owe you a favor?"

Baba had cackled at that suggestion, not remembering the date when she saved a Sarvitarian Emperor from certain demise. It had been Emperor Vitiatus and if Nix had learned anything during her history lessons, it was that emperor died two hundred years ago. Who knew humans could live as long as Baba? Even Baba herself said that the average human being was lucky to be able to celebrate their fiftieth anniversary.

"The Emperor grew old as we all do, Nix. Do not think too much about life in the city. It is not a matter of how but when you will go there, my gold coin," said Baba.

== Nix <ch:Nix02>
"You are late," said Baba who was waiting at the door, spatula in hand. Only when they visited Miroconium was it that Nix noticed that it was out-of-the-ordinary that a house could stand on mushrooms or that one could cook these mushrooms without the building collapsing on itself. The other houses she saw in the village used bricks instead of wood, a strange decision for Nix. Baba had explained to her that the people there feared fire, another oddity for Nix to hear. Why fear fire when she could hold it in her hands to light candles?

"I saw it! The mother bear!" answered Nix as she smelled the broccoli stew that came from the chimney. Her stomach rumbled.

"The mother bear!?! You bratty gold! What were you doing near that? It is is breeding season for them!" said Baba.

"I was fishing," Nix said, pointing to the catfish she had recovered. She was expecting to be scolded for a full day, condemned to reread the events leading to the separation of the Sarvitarian Empire into the Tiarmat and the Medean Empire.

Baba slapped the top of Nix’ head before taking her into her arms. Much to her surprise, Nix was sure she could see a tear from in the corner of Baba’s left eye which was blue whereas the other brown eye glowered. Baba would never let her mention this again. Like in the animal world, softness could be interpreted as weakness. Nix had read as much from the authors of the Regnassian and Sarvitarian eras. "Do not do this to me again. You are not her. Bring Spartak with you the next time. He is old enough to know."

"But I can use magic! If you show me a new..."

Baba whisked her fingers. Nix had been too loud. Someone from the village could have heard her. Why this could be an issue, Nix did not know. The only thing she wanted was for Baba to teach her that spell.

"That is too dangerous for you, my treasure," said Baba.

"I am old enough!"

Baba raised her voice. Somehow it trembled just like every time she spoke about her, the other girl. "No! She said the same thing too! She said she was old enough...Oh children these days!" said Baba. Nix now swore she saw tears on Baba’s rugged face, a visage on which age had laid its work but had not completed it. It was a face which the villagers said had not changed in decades. Perhaps Baba had found that sacred Fountain of Youth Regnant the Dragonslayer had died seeking.

"But I am not her! I am not that man Claradore you keep complaining about either! You know that Baba!" Claradore. A name she had gotten used to hearing throughout her life. Was he her papa? Baba had never answered that question. He too had lived with Baba for some years. Claradore had to be her papa. Nix was jealous of his exploits, him having mastered the blood harpoons when he was but a year younger than her. Baba would always console her saying he had an advantage.

"The Age of Magic is Claradore’s home," said Baba when she was not ranting about him bringing another child to the house. Nix had argued that more children meant that more people could aid with her chores. It seemed Baba spent her days riding a broom or collecting berries and mushrooms. Surely she did not mind more helpers seeing how the dishes accumulated in the kitchen.

"I know you are not her nor him...You are you...My little gold coin..." said Baba. #emph[Has she always looked sad when talking about them?] At night, Nix would sneak out from her bunk bed to salvage food only to find Baba crying while muttering their names. #emph[What did they do to Baba?] Baba never talked about them no matter how obstinate Nix asked, a maze of secrets she harbored.

All Nix could guess was that they were also taught in the arts by Baba with Claradore being the most talented. Had they even lived all together at the same time? Perhaps not. The other spot on the bunk bed had been salvaged to build a chair long before Nix’ time. The other girl and Nix had been the same: brought here as babies. On another hand, Claradore found Baba. Baba said only women sought her. In fact, Claradore was aware, before he met her, that Baba was a Magi. The sole possession that remained of him at Baba’s house was that notebook in which he drew places Nix had never heard of. From floating palaces high in the skies to warriors riding dragons, Claradore’s sketchbook was something to behold, an imagination capable of generating an entire universe. And then there were the spiders. To Nix, the exactitude of Claradore’s drawings or rather his obsession with a spider’s anatomy was bewildering. There was this passion and melancholy from the way he depicted their eight eyes and their mouths. Maybe he had been hired to illustrate the books Baba gave to her. It would make a good story.

"Then, show me how to do it. I want to make that bear run away like you did with those wolves! I will be able to protect you and Spartak the next time those wolves come to the farm," said Nix.

Baba breathed a sigh of exasperation. "The Goddess damn you children, making this old woman reveal all her secrets one at a time... I will show it to you, on one condition: that you skin me another coat for the winter."

Nix jumped around like a giddy child. Finally, she was going to learn it. The wolves raiding their farm yelped much the first time Baba did it, morphing her entire body into the semblance of a red armored knight with shield and bloodied lance. Nix had applauded for almost an hour, begging Baba to teach her that spell.

"Yes! It’s a promise...What is there for supper? I am hungry," said Nix.

"Salt your fish and put it away in the kitchen. I made some pork ribs to go with the broccoli stew."

There were three knocks on the old bamboo door. #emph[A customer?] They always came at night. As if they were ashamed of it. Nix never understood why. She was about to head to her bunk bed, the sound almost causing her to slip on that one uneven step Baba had built out of spite.

"You will understand as you grow older," simply said Baba. The door opened, revealing a girl not much older than Nix. If she had to guess, the girl would be at most fifteen. Unlike Nix, her skin was not as tanned. #emph[Not an Elysian, like me.] In addition, she wore earrings shaped in the form of doves. #emph[A believer.] Maybe after the ceremony, Nix would ask her where to buy those.

"How much?" asked the girl, her green eyes betraying her wariness.

"Twelve drachmas," said Baba. The same lie she told for the past year.

The girl clasped Baba’s hands. "I can’t afford this. Please."

"Go home, I am not offering this service anymore," lied Baba. Why did Baba have to lie? Nix knew it was related to the Faith. The Goddess forbade it for a reason she could not pick up. Yet Baba held the ceremony at least four times a year.

"Please! You have to understand! I had no choice! He forced me! Please! Please! Please! You are the only one who does this!" pleaded the girl as she put herself on her knees before Baba. The few times Baba became a Goddess to these girls.

Baba began closing the door. "You are putting all of us at risk, girl. If the Faith finds out about this..."

The girl put her foot at the door’s hinge. "No! Please! The bishop! The bishop sent me! I-I had no choice. I-I couldn’t refuse him."

"The bishop?" Baba said, her hand placed on her forehead.

"It is true, madam! I swear by the Goddess! Please! You have to help me! I cannot live with this!"

Baba groaned. She always ended up yielding and Nix knew it. Bargaining was never her strong suit. None of the lies managed to hide the truth: Baba would always do it, free of charge. "Grab the silphium, my little gold coin," said Baba to Nix.

Nix opened a jar of herbs. The plant she was looking for had yellow flowers and stumpy leaves. On a normal day, Baba would extract its sap as odiferous as it was savorous. She had an exquisite recipe involving sauteed the plant to make the stalks crusty and crunchable. Nix tried her best to hide her annoyance at the herb being used on a complete stranger, an expensive one on top of it. Legend has it that the Sarvitaurian Emperors kept a cache in their treasuries. During the last days of the Tiarmat Empire, the plant was as valuable as gold.

Baba boiled the plant, telling her client to take off her clothes. Sometimes they screamed. A lot. Once, a middle-aged lady cried throughout the entire night. Nix thought she had lost her hearing from the ordeal. This is why she had to gag them while dodging the flurries of kicks and nail swipes. How one could strike the people that they asked for help was beyond her. She hoped this one would miss all of her hits, her last bruise taking months to heal.

The girl was laid down on a fur mat made of deer hide. Nix gave her a spoonful of soup, in the hopes that this would soothe prior to the ceremony. She could hear the girl’s frenetic heartbeat from here. Why were other women as anxious as this during the service?

"You will understand as you grow older," said Baba again. #emph[Every time. but I am old enough now. I should know.]

Silphium. In the simmering pot, it smelled like Baba or Nix associated it with Baba. She did not know what came first. Nix never sniffed her own mother. She had assumed every mother smelled of silphium. Fifteen minutes under high heat were needed to create the concoction.

"What is your name, girl?" said Baba.

"Hippolita," said the girl. #emph[Typical name of the Imperial Tongue.]

"How old is the bishop?" said Baba.

"Seventy two," said Hippolita. Baba winced in utter disgust. Seventy-two was the highest answer Nix had ever heard. #emph[Aren’t large numbers a good thing?]

By the time the recipe sizzled, Baba collected two cups in a bowl.

"Will it hurt? Please tell me that it won’t," asked the girl.

"Yes," said Nix who seized the girl’s legs. #emph[Please don’t kick me in the face.]

Baba poured the bowl into Hippolita’s mouth. Her customer gagged in an instant, her body contorting itself in demonic violence. Baba restrained her arms while her legs gyrated and flailed, Nix’s arms aching in pain. The screams. Nix rolled her eyes. The part she absolutely adored was upon them. The girl let out wails that ruptured through the small house, shaking a younger Baba’s portrait hung on the walls . Wails so strident that they could have burst the cracked windows. Wails so unholy even wolves and grown bears dared not approach the house at night. Nix wanted to slap the girl. #emph[I am definitely losing my hearing for this.] She held on in spite of the throbbing pain in her shoulders. They spent ten minutes. Ten excruciating minutes holding their client.

Pee. It was all over Nix’ face. She was thankful anything solid had not come out of the girl unlike the previous ones. Her hands craved for a towel. Hippolita’s spasms had been relentless. The hot bath could not come any sooner.

The violent cries stopped when blood leaked from Hippolita’s lower parts. #emph[It’s over. It’s finally over.] Nix felt her grip loosen up.

"Do not look, Hippolita! It is not for the faint of hearts," said Baba.

Baba gestured her to bring a towel. Hippolita was drenched in sweat, blood and urine. Another mess for Nix to clean up. #emph[Maybe Baba should stop giving the service after all.] She grabbed the mop and began swiping the desecrated floor. The entire house would continue to stink for the next week, Baba asking her to buy some perfume at Miroconium every time.

"It is done, girl. Go home and tell the other women to not come here again," said Baba. Another lie. #emph[Why do you have to lie again Baba? I don’t understand.]

== Nix <ch:Nix03>
Baba was sewing another tunic for her. She had acquired some red silk from the village, at a reasonable price, the cherry on top of the cake. How was a question that Baba always teased her about. Maybe it came from a princeling’s tomb, an answer which would always frighten Nix who had a total of seven outfits, all made by Baba, some of the fabric even lasted her entire childhood.

"Do you want a motif on it?" said Baba. The patterns and embroidery Baba made were out of this world. Nix looked at the Tiarmat hydra on her robe, its five heads entertwined with one another. It seemed to hiss with the energy of despair, a struggle long lost. The inspiration had been obvious: the famous painting where the Molochian centaur was locked in a fateful battle with the hydra who wrapped its venomous fangs on its enemy’s limbs. Nix admired how all of the heads expressed their anger and demoralization in a different way. She had little to no sympathy for the centaur who had willingly ventured into the hydra’s den. #emph[The hydra has children too, like the mother bear. If someone went into my nest, I would attack them too.]

"A phoenix. Can it be a phoenix this time?" said Nix.

Baba nodded, tucking her under her bed cover. "A phoenix it will be then. Have you taken a liking to the Medean Empire now, my gold coin?"

"I want something else than a hydra. I have already five tunics with hydras."

"It is a shame the Tiarmat no longer exists."

That answer always disappointed Nix. The Tiarmat Empire, one of the successors of the Sarvitarian Empire who authored much of the encyclopedias she devoured, gone before she was even born. Baba told her about the times when the legions still patrolled the imperial roads next to Miroconium, the days when she still received shipments of grain from the provinces now occupied by the Cachalots. Back then, cities did not need walls. Children could play outside the makeshift palissades without meeting a single Molochian. In the golden days of the Sarviatarian Empire, Baba had travelled extensively, some of the dishes Nix ate in came from Persiphon, other utensils were forged at Cyclonia, now ruled by the Vyrmogothians. #emph[How lucky Baba was lucky to have lived under the Sarvitarians’ protection.]

Baba had told her the tales of the first time the Known World faced the Molochians. It had been the only time she agreed with the Faith. Molochians, the Scourge of the Goddess, men who were drawn with such grotesquery in Nix’ books that she got nightmares for three consecutive days after reading that chapter. They were depicted as horned devils with teeth larger than the mother bear’s, their skin as red as the Medean phoenix and their eyes devoid of pupils. It was then that Nix noticed how the lack of eye contact could sour any first impression.

The novels spoke about these men who ate children, slaughtering all before them. One of the greatest sections Nix had ever read described how all barbarian people: Cachalots, Rauthengardians, Clovians, Domaceans and Vyrmogothian banded together with the Tiarmat and Medean Empires, clashing with the invaders during the Battle of the Megidollaean Plains. Even the Elysian Empire from which she was supposedly from, sent contingents. So much of Nix’ time had been spent drawing sketches of that titanic struggle for the waning empire’s survival, works of art that Baba framed in her own room.

Of course, Nix could never hope to compete with Claradore’s skills. A single of the mandibles that man drew had more details than any of the hydras Nix showed to Baba with enthusiasm.

"Baba! I’m never going to be as good as Claradore," Nix said.

Baba would always pinch her cheekbones. "You don’t have to be as good as Claradore, my little treasure. Look at the variety of your drawings. All that boy ever drew was those accursed spiders," Baba said.

"Why did he only draw spiders?"

Baba would make this exaggerated sigh. Somehow despite her endless complaining about him, there was this ember that lit within Baba’s pupils every time she talked about Claradore’s aptitudes in the magical arts. Nix always imagined what her life could have been had both of them shared Baba’s roof simultaneously. Having someone who bested her at both magic and art. A challenge she would welcome. With enough training, she could do it: surpass him and make Baba applaud her. Baba would then never complain about Claradore again.

"His...misfortunes made him obsessed with spiders. He has lived through … exceptional events."

#emph[You did not answer the question, Baba!]

One of these days, one of these days, she would ask Baba for the entire story on Claradore and that other girl who stayed here. Who were they really? How good was that other girl with magic? Were they Elysians too? Were they also as old as Baba right now? Why spiders of all things for Claradore? Did they also read the same books as her? What did they think about Regnant the DragonSlayer? Did they also want to save the Tiarmat Empire like she does? What were their favorite color? So many questions.

But the questions that Nix wanted answers to the most...Baba had also promised to talk about Nix’ parents on her sixteenth’s birthday. #emph[Only five more years.] No matter how much Nix had insisted on that topic, Baba would always rebuke her, claiming that she was not old enough to understand. Sixteen. Baba had promised to bake her her favorite recipe for a cake, one she had not done in a century. Nix had seen it in the cookbook. Baba had called it the sponge cake, its secrets derived from the Unknown World itself. One had to mix eggs, mint, flour, sugar and pandan leaves, which could only be obtained from the fringes of the Elysian Empire in order to make this delectable fantasy that made Nix salivate intensively everytime she read the recipe. She could not wait to be sixteen.

"But the Last Tiarmat Emperor, Darnik! He can reclaim his throne like Regnant the Dragonslayer did!" said Nix.

Baba burst into a series of playful laughs, almost dropping the tunic she was working on. She rocked her chair with such force that Nix was worried that she might fall off.

"My gold coin, Darnik is not Regnant the Dragonslayer. The last Tiarmat Emperors were not the charming princes your books, written by the Medeans, claim them to be."

"What do you mean, Baba?"

"What if you were to write a book about yourself? Would you ever describe yourself as feeble, as incompetent, as a mere puppet to the generals and eunuchs who you are supposed to command? Of course not, my gold coin, trust me. I have had a Sarvitarian Emperor stay in this very room you now occupy. He too wrote himself like the fairest of all men, the most intelligent of all. He who lost while outnumbering Rauthengardians of all barbarians made himself as a fantastic general in his memoirs. Oh the agony of having read that turd of a book he sent me as a thank you note," said Baba.

It was Nix’ turn to start laughing. Baba had told her many stories of that Sarvitarian Emperor requiring her assistance to do the most basic of things from washing his bloodstained clothing, folding laundry to skinning a duck. The sight of Tiarmat, Medean, Sarvitarian Emperors being followed by a swarm of eunuchs attending their every need like a queen bee made her giggle. Once, Nix had the audacity to draw a dwarf acting as a toilet for an emperor. That drawing. It was the only masterpiece Baba helped her personally complete. It now hung next to what Nix assumed was a wedding portrait from the heyday of the Sarvitarian Empire.

"Maybe Darnik just needs the Goddess to help him expel the Rauthengardians from Metarexia..." said Nix.

"Oooooh, I would not count of that woman..." said Baba.

"Why not? Doesn’t the Faith say she is almighty and the most powerful woman in history? The books say she can destroy dragons with lightning bolts. What can the Rauthengardians do against her?"

Baba stopped sewing. #emph[Did I say something wrong?] She pondered looking at Nix’s room. Only then did Nix notice that she never cleared the cobwebs Baba had asked her to clean up yesterday. Somehow, she shared this bad habit with that man, Claradore, according to Baba. How did she not come to fear spiders like Baba and the girls in the village was a mystery even to Baba. Spiders, these allies that ate roaches and mosquitoes, waiting with tedious patience for prey to enter their domain. Spiders, these creatures that were not insects because they had eight legs instead of six. There was something admirable or rather elegant about that quality. Why run after your food when you could simply watch them from your bed while they inevitably land on your territory? #emph[It is a smart way of hunting.]

"The Goddess...There is a lot of things the Faith’s scripture do not tell you. What can I tell you? She may be the strongest woman in the Known World but she will surely not help the girl we assisted that other day, nor the others," said Baba.

"Why? Why doesn’t she help these women like you do? What is stopping her from doing it? She was there when the Rauthengardian deposed Darnik. Why was she not there in the Battle of the Megidollaean Plains? Why did she let the Tiarmat Empire fall? Why is she never there in the books when people need her? I don’t understand. People always pray for her to be there!"

Baba touched Nix’ braid, five-stranded, the same style as her own. The village women had told her that this fashion was outdated since the beginning of the Molochian invasions. Nix never paid much attention to that. She felt she looked like one of these women whom the artists of the Sarvitarian Empire’s zenith loved to sculpt. Perhaps one day, a sculptor would ask to make a painted bust out of her similar to the hundreds she had seen at Miroconium. Moreover, her hairstyle was simple and pretty, why change it?

"Maybe you can go Metarexia and ask her yourself when you are older. You have read the books. Every year, the Goddess meets the Faithful at Metarexia during the Day of Humility," said Baba.

"If she is too busy, why can’t someone else do it? Someone who can use magic?"

"You will find out when you grow older that no matter how strong you think you are, it will never be sufficient to save all of what you love. Such is life, my gold coin," said Baba.

== Nix <ch:Nix04>
Her arms melted first. She concentrated her thoughts around her very self. When one performed magic, it was imperative that the soul must resonate with the body. Baba had told her that much. #emph[Breathe...Slowly...Relax] The first time, her body had been too stiff, preventing the magic from coursing through her veins. Nix heard the grass rustle on this uneventful morning. She no longer smelled the cow manure coming from the village. Curtains of red descended from her eyelids. The play had started. She felt her head melt. Voices, male and female whispered in her head. Some of them spoke in the Classical Tongue, others in the Imperial Tongue. There was one tongue, though, one elusive language which she had never deciphered. It always said one word. Three syllabes.

To conduct magic was to travel through the plane of one’s existence. Nix witnessed again the time Baba gave her a book on the Conquests of Magnavalon, where the modern day Clovians now occupied. She remembered how perplexed she had been seeing all these characters strung along that Baba made sounds with. To start with the Classical Tongue was to master all other languages, save that one tongue. It whispered again the word. #emph[What does it mean?]

Her neck liquified, then her torso. Her legs supported nothing. She let them fade away as well. The sensation of being unaffected by gravity. Nix failed to describe it. She moved on the soil as swiftly as the deadliest vipers, as silently as a wolf stalking its prey, as naturally as a waterfall.

She flowed, wanting to become a river that followed its natural course. Her flesh went down hills, cascading upon pebbles and rocks, mice, beetles evading her current form. The limitations of a solid state befuddled her. A fact Nix had not accepted was that everyday people went on without being able to traverse the most simple of obstacles. Lock or not, doors could be defeated by going beneath them. All walls had holes and tears, created by years of decades of wear. Here, Nix could sashay between twigs, masquerade as a shadow, enter ants’ nest. A sense of unattainable freedom. Freedom from the hardness of materials, freedom from tangible barriers. Nix laughed, her body not even being able to make a single sound at this very instant.

She swore. She cursed. She yelled. Nothing. Nothing but peace and the sound of nature calling. Nix heard all from the foxes doing their mating call, the larks and pigeons singing their odes from their balconies of branches to the cicadas conducting their symphonies by the use of their miniature timbals. As a liquid, the animal kingdom welcomed her with open arms like Baba did at home. Nix giggled, turning her form towards a glowing stream.

Diving into the river, water and blood became one. Nix closed what were her eyes, letting the stream rock her being. Her soul swayed upstream, downstream, left and right. A multitude of droplets massaged her body. If she had any worries coming into the river, they had been dissipated. Such was the uniqueness of merging one’s existence with water, a fluid that was quintessential to life, One of the five elements according to Baba. The Faith said The Goddess created water from her saliva. All humans being children of the Goddess meant that all kissed their mother when drinking water. #emph[How poetic.] It was in this mental state that Nix wondered if she had ever tasted her mother’s water.

"Who is my mother?" Nix had asked Baba once. Baba’s face was afflicted by such pain that Nix had never dared to bring up the topic again. It had been one of the rare times Baba’s voice failed to find any words, similar to someone having stabbed her in the groin. The pain. Nix had never forgotten Baba’s eyes as pitiful as a lost kitten’s. Then, she had learned that adults could cry.

Mother. A word Baba had refused to let herself be referred to as. Nix had accepted that as a fact.

Father. Men never came to Baba’s house. In fact, she had never spoken more than a sentence to any man. Buying bread and trading fur in the village were her only occasions to interact with them. Nix knew everyone had a mother and a father. Some children played with them games she had played with Baba.

"Who is my father?" she had asked Baba, hoping the answer would be Claradore.

"A putrid mess like Claradore and all men," answered Baba who would often cry out a man’s name in her sleep, her voice ridden with righteous anger. Nix had heard the violent thuds when Baba kicked her bed’s frame while cursing. From what she could guess, Baba’s fairy tale wedding happened in a time when Baba could be imagined as young, a mental image Nix could never hope to form inside her head. Her charming prince plucked Baba’s petals, gifting them to another flower, one less eloquent and less ravishing, leaving only the thorns to Baba. Nix’ intended name for Spartak had been his name. She would never forget how Baba berated that name for two long hours.

As for Claradore...A name Baba had wanted to teach her as the synonym of male disappointment. When Nix came to the village, she had been surprised to learn that this meaning was Baba’s invention and not a current idiom.

"Was he a good magician?" she had asked Baba.

"The best, my gold coin. I have never seen anyone like him. The Known World thinks us Magi are extinct. Claradore is living proof The Faith has lied for centuries," said Baba.

"Then, he can teach me magic! He should know how to breath fire from my lungs like your books show!"

"And have you follow the same path of shame that he did? Not a chance, my gold coin, you are too valuable to this old woman," said Baba as she buried Nix ’s head in her arms. "Losing another to the vices of magic...I do not know if I will have the strength to relive that."

Water thrashed around her. Something howled horribly. Her vision was confronted by a fox, its fur as bright as a sunrise. She felt herself enter its body through its tongue. Nix screamed. Nothing came out. The fox’ squeals grew ever horrendous, their ringing screeching in what were her ears. Her body flailed, contorting itself in an abrupt manner. Lungs, throat, stomach, every fiber of the mammal’s body absorbed her essence whether both of them approved of it or not. She did not understand. None of her books ever drew this scenario.

Nix saw a combination of black and red swimming before her eyes. Everything around her twirled violently. Her head spun. She struggled to maintain control. Control. Control of what, she asked. The world turned and turned at an increasing velocity and so did her soul and flesh within the fox’ insides.

She awoke in a starry void. Galaxies and planets orbiting around her. Her hands. They had materialized. Nix touched her face. Skin. Solid flesh. #emph[Where am I?] Her feet dangled in mid air, neither feeling cold nor tepid. No wind, no soil, no water, only emptiness greeted both her toes and her fingers.

A boy stood before her, a tarantula tattooed on his back, drawn in the same style as Claradore’s.

"You have done it, my dear," said the boy in the Classical Tongue. An accent she had never heard. They were around the same age yet this feeling...She could not ascertain it but he seemed older.

"Who are you?" she asked.

"That is not important right now, my dear," he said, making a grin that managed to draw and repel her at the same time. #emph[What do I make of this?] One step backwards. One step forward. Flee or approach. What did her body desire? Even Nix could not solve that dilemma. Seeing her reaction, the boy smiled in a tender way, one that copied Baba’s kindness. He glowed, radiating this known homeliness that made her heart beat with anticipation. #emph[A friend?] She took a step towards him.

"Do you know what you have even accomplished just now, my dear?" said the boy.

He spoke in riddles and she disliked riddles. "Why do you call me my dear and what are you babbling about?"

"You have yet to realize it, my dear Nix, but you have paved the way for our ultimate triumph."

"I don’t understand, what are you talking about? And how do you know my name?"

"Breathe...Then open your eyes. You will see what the True Goddess has in store for someone as unique as you, my dear," said the boy. He clapped his hands, causing Nix’ body to gasp for air. #emph[It hurts.] Her lungs seared from the inside out, the boy lit a wildfire within them. She tried to breathe. The galaxies and planets hovering around her disappeared in a white flash while the boy fell apart, reduced to dust.

An orange paw greeted her eyes when she could open them again. Water. She was before the river again. Nix howled at her own reflection and so did the fox gazing back at her. #emph[Impossible! How did this...] Her being swallowed by the animal. The boy’s cryptic words. Astonishment and clarity clashed over her mind.

Nix showed her tongue and teeth. The fox followed. She raised a paw. The animal copied her move. What had transpired could not have been possible but reality now disappointed her in another way. She made the fox lick its claws and wag its tail. #emph[This...How? Why?]

#emph[Drink.] Water tasted the same as a fox, somewhat upsetting her. With her new ears, the stream now seemed to roar within the confines of its bed. Even the shy rabbits and peaceful cicadas bellowed instead of making gentle sounds. Her mind could deduce even the distance to the nearer rabbit, a thought that would had never crossed her as a human. #emph[Splendid! I must tell Baba about this!]

She ran. Treelines, bushes, protruding roots, all zoomed in front of the fox’ eyesight. Her speed amazed her, being four to fives times faster than when sprinting as a human. Nix ordered the fox to do joyous barks, having run around the river for an incalculable amount of time. Time. A concept she was sure animals had no idea of. Her mind could not tell her how many minutes nor hours she had spent loafing around in this body. She rolled on the trail, licking the mud off her fur, tasting mushrooms and berries Baba forbade her to eat, chased after rodents as small as her hand. The ability to spot any mouse hidden in the densest vegetation baffled her.

Nix found herself resting on the banks of the river, her mouth panting in profusion, only growing alarmed when her eyes stared at the ending sunset. #emph[How do I exit this?] The fox’s heartbeat accelerated. Its legs and head convulsed, its mouth made dreadful sounds. Blood raced from one organ to another. Nix listened to it: the flow. She felt it anew. Nix had to become one with the water again. She closed her eyes, allowing herself to be ferried.

Before long, she found herself face down on cold sand with a sore throat. She coughed and vomited, spilling mucus all over herself. The rest of her body ached. Hands and feet tingled as she readjusted to having a physical body. Blood. Her nose bled. Baba would scold her again on top of returning to the house without her clothes. #emph[I am in so much trouble. What will I say to her?]

Next to her, the fox rasped as if it was dying, vomiting in abundance. Never would she forget how fast it scurried away from her when it noticed her presence.

== Nix <ch:Nix05>
"Wake up! Wake up!" Baba said. Nix groaned. An orange light flared in her room, lighting Baba’s worried face. Nix had never seen her as alarmed as she was.

"What is going on?" asked Nix.

"Get dressed and stay in the house no matter what. Do not go outside, " said Baba as she snuffed the candles.

"I don-t..."

Baba hugged her with such intensity that Nix’s bones could have snapped. #emph[I can’t breathe.] The tender touch that patted her back every night returned. Nix did not understand. #emph[What is going on? Why did you wake me up just to hug me?]

"Do you love me?" said Baba, her blue and brown eyes as luminous as a child’s.

"O-O-Of course!" said Nix. Baba’s teeth made the prettiest smile Nix had ever witnessed. To see Baba so happy made her night.

"I’ve never told you about your mother now did I?"

"I don’t need a mother! I have you!"

"I am glad, my gold coin." She dropped something in Nix’ hands, a medallion. Dried blood covered a silver griffon. Actual silver. Nix assumed the ornament was as expensive as the entirety of Baba’s possessions. The writing on it, a tongue Nix did not recognize. She rotated the medallion to find a keyhole.

"It is written in the Elysian Tongue. Perhaps if you go to the Elysian Empire you will find answers on how to open it," said Baba.

"I don’t want to go the Elysian Empire! I want to stay here with you! You told me we would go to Thanatopolis next year!"

Baba made the same expression as Spartak when it got injured. #emph[Did I do anything wrong?] She gave Nix another hug, this one more passionate than the other. A hug that wanted to be reassuring through its desperation. Nix had never received this type of hug. She had expected Baba’s embrace to bring this warmth and this courage that guided her against the monsters which hid under her bed. Cold. The word was insufficient to describe this hug. Nix’ hair was raised. The temperature in the house had dropped by at least ten degrees. Had winter come this early this year? "Thank you, my gold coin. I love you too. Please, please hide in the house before I come back," said Baba, her voice cracking.

"This is bizarre, Baba. What is going on?"

"OPEN THE DOOR!" screamed a man’s voice coming from the kitchen. Infernal knocks were heard, each pounding the wooden door with the aggressivity of a mad boar. Shoes and boots stomped the premises of Baba’s abode.

"I am coming," said Baba. Nix sensed that Baba was struggling to form that sentence.

"I’ll come with you! I need to get Spartak," said Nix.

"NO! YOU HAVE TO HIDE! STAY HERE AND DO NOT UTTER A SINGLE WORD. AM I CLEAR?" Baba screamed with the ferocity of the mother bear. In that instant, she commanded Nix’s full obedience. In that moment, even the Medean Emperor could have bowed before her.

Nix wrapped herself in her drapes while Baba headed downstairs. Peering through the window, she saw an army of torches arrayed in front of the door. The Faith’s dove banners were flown by Men of the Crucible or monks dressed up in soldiers’ gear as Baba loved to call them. Men and women, their pupils glowing in the tranquil darkness, all armed with pitchforks and clubs. All looked at the door with the same intent as the mother bear. The girl Nix and Baba helped stood next to a man dressed in a formal attire. #emph[What was her name again? I forgot.] Bruises and dried tears had found their way into her face which Nix could relate to. She had made the same expression when seeing the mother bear. That man. Nix had only seen his costume in encyclopedias relating to the Faith. Gold embroidery glittered under his torch. Unlike the other men, the Man in White remained calm and composed, his lips singing the Faith’s hymns. Men of the Crucible flanked him, reciting verses of the Gospel. The pungent smell of incense invaded the air, as if Nix had stepped inside one the Faith’s churches. #emph[A prince or a cardinal?]

"I am here, what do you want," said Baba as she opened the door.

"WITCH! BABE KILLER! MAY YOU ROT IN HELL!" screamed a man. The other humans repeated the words in synchrony. Another spat at Baba’s face. #emph[What are they talking about? Baba is not a witch.]

"You people certainly know how to make friends," said Baba while wiping the saliva from her nose.

"You do not have the luxury for sarcasm, witch. Do you have any idea what sacrilege you have committed? An affront to the Goddess on MY holy land?" said the Man in White.

"Sacrilege? Everything is heresy to you Faithful! What I am accused of this time? Of shitting in my own toilet? Feeding my cows? Wearing a skirt? I do not have the time to entertain you lot. If you have any complaints, tell your Emperor, what was his name again? Ah Vitiatus! Tell Emperor Vitiatus, he owes me his life! That brat wouldn’t be on the throne if I hadn’t nursed him!"

"You are mad as they say. Emperor Vitiatus? That was two hundred years ago, witch! What kind of demon has possessed you to believe you saved a dead man?"

"She is a witch, Father, you have the evidence, burn her!" implored a Man of the Crucible, his eyes reddening like a rabid wolf.

"WITCH! BABE KILLER! DEATH! DEATH! DEATH!" echoed the crowd as they banged their pitchforks on the ground.

"SILENCE! We are not the savage Molochians but civilized beings, fellow citizens. What would we be without our morals and standards?" said the Man in White. The men and women stayed silent, looking at the Man in White the same way Nix looked at her favorite book. "Yes, we are the Faithful, the paragons of justice and goodness in the Known World, the harbringers of civilization, the light that shines through the eternal darkness, are we not? It is our responsibility, is it not? To show this witch the goodness of the Goddess, we shall grant her a fair trial. Let the Goddess decide if she is guilty!" said the Man in White. Nix sighed. The crowd exploded in frenzied applause, showering the apostle with incomprehensible praise and with prayers. "Seize her."

Two Men of the Crucible grabbed Baba’s wrists with their bronze gauntlets. Baba attempted to bite one of them only to be jabbed in the stomach. Nix gasped, shuddering under her drapes. #emph[Should I do something...What should I do? What can I do? But Baba told her to hide.] Nothing could bring her warmth. Everything froze when she touched it. She heard her own heart’s pulses animated by a folly, one which caused her legs to shake faster than a woodpecker’s pecks. #emph[Leave us alone! We didn’t do anything wrong!]

"In accordance to the fairest of all trials, The Goddess asks us to bring forth a witness to this witch’s crimes. The Goddess be exalted! Today we are blessed by Her Eminence: a witness has agreed to testify against this vile fiend... Come, girl," said the Man in White to the girl Nix and Baba helped.

Nix saw that Baba glared at the girl, her eyes making this sort of silent accusation Nix had only seen when she had made a terrible mistake.

"Girl, have you truly witnessed it? This witch, has she murdered an unborn babe in front of your very eyes," said the Man in White, a wide grin creeping up on his face.

"It is true, Father," said the girl. The crowd uttered gasps of disapproval, raising their pitchforks. They hurled profanities at Baba, more spat at her. A Man of the Crucible struck Baba’s face. #emph[Stop it please!]

"Do you swear it? In the name of the Goddess who gave birth to us all?"

"I swear it, by the Goddess."

The crowd’s insults grew louder and louder. Their mouths appeared to transform, bringing forth sharp and elongated teeth craving for blood. Bloodshot eyes gazed hungrily at Baba. The Men of the Crucible now looked like metallic hounds released from the far depths of the Underworld. Nix waited for the moment she would wake up to find herself in Baba’s arms again. There were too many monsters in this nightmare and she was afraid.

"Guilty! GUILTY, my most pious citizens, is the Goddess’ verdict! In all her wiseness, the Goddess has proclaimed this accursed witch guilty of murdering a babe in cold blood. Oh! The humanity! To think that a serial killer was living in our peaceful community! One that slaughters children! CHILDREN! CHILDREN! The most vulnerable of all! What is more important than the sanctity of a child’s life? Oh! Goddess! Children of the Faith, we cannot possibly let such a monster live in our faithful community, can we? No, no, no, you are all as intelligent as the Goddess wanted you to be. I hereby offer this witch the death penalty as the harshest and fairest punishment for her deeds," said the Man in White

"What about the witch-spawn, milord? An Elysian. She lives inside the house. As far I know, she is capable of witchcraft too," said the girl. Nix stopped looking through the window. #emph[What do I do now?]

"NO! NO! NO! DON’T YOU DARE! It is me you want, not her! Grant her the dignity of life!" screamed Baba, her nails attempting to claw away at her captors. A stick was inserted into her mouth to silence her.

"Burn the house, let the witch-spawn join her corruptor in Hell. Mercy for the child tainted by paganism," said the Man in White.

Baba hollered horrible bawls as they tied her to a tree. The girl pelted her forehead with a stone. Men of the Crucible landed blow after blow on Baba’s head. The sound of bones snapping. Nix shut her ears as she sprinted to the front door. She had to save Baba and Spartak. Nix went down the familiar spiral stairs, knowing that the third step had always been uneven. The marinated chicken Baba put on the kitchen table watched her try to unlock the door only to encounter a perverse resistance. #emph[It’s jammed from the outside.] Nix banged it incessantly, screeching with deafening intensity. She had to save Baba. Smoke. There was smoke. Torches were flung at the house, the flames they ignited devouring the roof. She had to save Baba. Nix kept on hitting the door with her hands, feet, back, head. It would not budge. Above, a black mist consumed the chimney where Baba had taught her how to light a fire with magic. The flames consumed Baba’s portrait in the living room, one that portrayed her marriage when the Sarvatarian Empire was still whole. Nix’ hands and feet bled. Outside, Baba wailed when Nix heard projectiles hitting her body.

Behind Nix, the stairs she had came by disintegrated in a trail of ashes. Her bunk bed covered in soot crashed into the kitchen. The pillow she needed to fend off the darkness. Gone. The tunics Baba had knit for her in eight different colors. Turned into black powder. She inhaled the smoke, coughing at the destruction of what she had called home. Home, a thing some children in fairy tales did not possess. She had been lucky to have a place she had called home. Nix wept and wept as she kept battering the locked door with her wounded body parts. What was she to do? Her true mother’s medallion laid on the broken floor.

#emph[No! Please! This is too cruel.] If she could save Baba, they could rebuild it. They would run. Far. Far away from the Man in White. Maybe near Thanatopolis where they could build a bigger house with a room for Spartak. She had to save Baba.

A blazing beam fell on her leg. Her upper body rolled in pain as the flames seared her flesh. The smell of burning skin and blood flooded her nose alongside the already overwhelming smoke. Her tongue tasted blood. #emph[So that is how death smells like];. The sealed door stood before her. Impregnable, indestructible, undefeatable, condemning her to suffocate in the place where she had felt the safest. Nix hit it one last time to no avail. #emph[Baba...I’m sorry.] Her eyes closed, resigning themselves to eternal slumber.

In her sleep, she felt someone grab her. Her eyesight fluttered, seeing a man burst through the door, a tarantula tattooed on his chest. Baba’s body hung on the Hollow Tree, lifeless tears drying out on her maimed face. Perhaps Nix was waking up from the nightmare.

"If only I could have come sooner. Destiny has its own strange way of reuniting both of us, my dear Nix," her savior said. She glanced at him using the last ounce of strength she had left. Eyes that fit the description of a fairy tale prince. A stout body that could match the most proud of bulls. And the spider tattoo, an exact replica of Claradore’s artstyle. The resemblance was uncanny if not lacked subtility.

"Baba..." she croaked.

"I’m sorry...We shall both mourn her, my dear," he said.

== Nix <ch:Nix06>
She cradled Spartak in her arms, walking in this wretched monotony that was now her life. #emph[Baba...] Home...She wanted to go home. Above, the sky always seemed dark now, no matter how blue Claradore said it was. The black crows that flew overhead hid whatever sunlight the Goddess shed on the path her body walked on without her permission.

#emph[How did it come to this?] The first morning without Baba waking her up. The first day without a breakfast on the table she had come to know. The first day without access to Baba’s arsenal of kitchen tools. The first day without climbing the spiral staircase, reaching for Baba’s book collection. The first night without a bedtime story. This surreal sentiment of living in a dream. Nix’ body moved on its own. Her mind loitered around, the villagers’ deranged screams and Baba’s bones’ snapping echoing in her ears.

#emph[How could they hate us so much?]

"Hear me now, a new decree I lay upon you: Love one another as I have loved you. Let it be your shield and your flag of honor. By this shall the realms of men know you as my true heirs—not by blood, nor by steel, but by the love you bear each other. So it shall be spoken; so it shall be done," said the Goddess to the army Regnant the Dragonslayer amassed at the end of the Age of Magic. The Man in White, he said they were all children of the Goddess. #emph[Why? Why do they hate us then?]

Her encyclopedias always mentioned violence in this rather casual manner. She knew wars happened and that men died. Yet wars and battles had been something of the distant past to her, something rare and foreign that Baba’s abode was immune to. To read this one line in a book in contrast with what The Faith had done to Baba… Nix could never fathom the extent of human brutality. That none of the adults that followed the Man in White thought to save her nor Baba like in the stories she was told …That they actually cheered as Baba agonized before their very eyes. It was unbelievable.

"You will not find any answers, thinking about it, my dear… Baba has proven herself to be weak...And the weak get beaten," Claradore said, offering her a fruit. "You should eat..." Spartak barked, her only cue to accept the food. Had one apple always been enough to fill her stomach? She had never realized how heavy an apple could be while digesting one and that it could be without a taste. Anything now weighed at least six times more and tasted the same. Drinking and eating were now necessities she had no concern for.

#emph[Baba...] Baba, a word that twisted the dagger the Man in White left in her soul. Baba, a word she would never say to Baba ever again. Claradore had healed her leg but the memory of flames ravaging her home eroded her like waves against a promontory. Eventually, she would fall down in the turpid ocean. Maybe that was a good thing as she would see Baba again.

"I want to go home," Nix said, her eyes fixated on the crows which now battled a dove in the sky. Their plumage...Black had never been as beautiful. She had been a fool to believe that yellow was her favorite color. Yellow, its brightness now irritated her beyond rationality. #emph[Baba always wore black.]

He patted her head. His touch was gentle so far. She stank of ashes and she knew it. He would not accept any of her apologies. "I’m sorry...You and I both saw what happened to your home..." he said.

Nix wept, causing Spartak to whimper. The sight of Baba’s body. This never happened in her fairy tales. Somebody should have saved her. #emph[This is unfair!] All her mind could do was show the body again and again. A page in a terrible children’s book that she could not turn, one that begged her to stay. Nothing. Night, day, wind, water, no element could delete this page from this nightmarish book. She screamed, ousting a flock of crows from their perches, hoping the extent of her rage would resuscitate the dead. The Goddess had to know. She had to know what pain her children had caused. #emph[You didn’t do anything, Goddess! Why! Why! WHY!]

Claradore hugged her. His arms were stronger, that she could tell. While they lacked the finesse of Baba’s embrace, they compensated with this tightness, the same feeling Regnant the Dragonslayer had when he first put on his dragonscale armor. Her bedtime hero had felt unbreakable, invincible when he had charged against the enemies of the Goddess. She could cry here to her heart’s contents and so she did, emptying herself on his chest. Never had she screamed so much in her entire life. Sleep had become near impossible without her bunk bed. Cooking was an ordeal without Baba’s elaborate kitchen set, one as extensive as a Sarvitarian legionnaire’s arsenal of spears and swords. Even peeing without Baba’s toilet...A confort she would never have again.

"Please...You know magic...Bring her back..." Nix said.

"If only it was that simple, my dear...You have known Baba longer than I ever had… Even if we could, what would she have said if you managed to drag her soul back from the Gates of the Underworld? Will she still cherish you, the one that prevented her from being reunited with her parents, her lover and the daughter she had to kill...Oh? Oh, you didn’t know, did you? She never told you? There is a reason tampering with the dead was forbidden in the Age of Magic. The dead must be allowed to cross the Gates so the living can continue their voyage," said Claradore as he let go of her. Magic. She saw that book he kept in his backpack. It whispered. It spoke to her with both female and male voices. It called in a tongue she had never learned yet understood.

"The Gates of the Underworld...Where are they?"

Claradore put himself at the same eye level as she did. Spartak licked his cheek. She could not believe how fast her dog had allowed itself to be fed by this stranger. Even though he was not Baba’s son, it was as if Nix saw two of Baba’s brown eye. "My dear, don’t you remember? You have already been there. In fact, both of us have already seen them in person."

#emph[What? I don’t understand.] Riddles and vagueness. This man adored riddles, his tongue delivering one every minute it would seem. Nix now understood why Baba had kicked him out.

He turned his back to her abruptly, his left arm gesturing for her to stay behind him. The book. Claradore unveiled it. As big as one of her encyclopedias, a tarantula was painstakingly drawn on its cover that showed traces of a craftmanship that could not have originated from either Regnassian nor Sarvitarian Empires. A foreign culture, people, their hopes, their stories and their grief, leaked from the papyrus pages. Nix was sure of it. The voices told her so. There was a way to reach the Gates of the Underworld inside.

The ground shook, whatever tremor approached them fast. Spartak barked with apprehension. They were but twenty imperial miles from Miroconium. It had to be the villagers. They had followed her. She started crying again. She could not do it. #emph[Leave me alone!] Why had the Goddess brought Baba to the Gates of the Underworld? Baba who had not wronged her? Metarexia, the Goddess’ residence. Nix would go there one day and demand answers.

The embodiment of years digging into her encyclopedias appeared before her eyes. Four riders , all Molochians emerged, wielding their bows. To her surprise, the infamous Scourge of Goddess had boring faces with short mustaches. Their miserable attempt of having facial hair made her laugh. #emph[Baba was scared of them?] Nix immediately spotted the officer, it was none other than the man who sported the crested helmet on which was embedded rubies and lapis lazuli. He donned a white cape, covering his lamellar armor, on which was painted the Medean crimson phoenix. And the shield, one which still showed the Tiarmat hydra hissing at any opponent who had the misfortune of gazing at it on a battlefield. #emph[A Scholae Palatinae. Baba...The encyclopedia...If only you could see this...]

As for the other Molochians, the books spoke true of them. They were barely taller than Baba. On horseback or on ponyback since Nix refused to consider those tiny mounts as horses, Claradore’s height still appeared higher. Their clothing varied from light and plain tunics to chainmail dubiously acquired from imperial forges. She hoped she would get to see their mounted archery skills. Baba had said that she had tried to imitate their style but had failed when she had sprained her knee while mounting her horse.

Claradore withdrew his spellbook. He turned to her with a friendly smirk. "We shall speak about the book later. Right now, it seems we will reach our destination faster than I have envisioned."

#emph[Destination?] She noticed that she never bothered to ask him where they were going. Baba would have scolded her. Little girls should never trust strangers without a sense of directions, Baba would have said. #emph[Well, I don’t have a choice right now, Baba. Sorry.]

"Where were you intent on taking me?" Nix asked.

"Magister Herbarum, we thought you were at Miroconium...I see your pilgrimage ended early," said the Scholae Palatinae.

"Scholae Palatinae Ordogan, a great pleasure to see you again," said Claradore with the same tone Baba used for sarcasm. #emph[Are you sure Baba that he is not your son?]

"The Emperor requests your immediate presence at Thanatopolis." The man signalled one of the Molochians to bring a riderless horse. "You will follow us."

#emph[The Medean Emperor never takes no for an answer. Thanatopolis... Baba has been there...Are we really going there? Oh, Baba, why? Why couldn’t you be here with me?]

"My, my as direct as always, Ordogan. There is a tiny hiccup: I have brought a student from my pilgrimage, one as talented as I was when I was her age. I humbly ask your permission for her to accompany me on this journey to the capital," said Claradore as he moved sideways, revealing Nix to the soldiers.

"An Elysian? This far away from home?" muttered one of the Molochians in a heavily accented Imperial Tongue. Such an outrageous pronunciation would have grated Baba’s ears.

Ordogan unmounted his horse. Claradore gestured for Nix and Spartak to come closer to the riders. To her surprise, the Scholae Palatinae knelt before her before saying something she did not understand. Seeing her reaction, he repeated the same syllables to no avail.

"He asked for your name in Elysian. Do not worry, my dear, I intend to teach you that language," said Claradore in the Classical Tongue. She saw that Ordogan’s eyes had widened. The other Molochians shouted in disbelief.

"The girl has lost someone dear to her recently. Please be kind to her," continued Claradore.

"My condolences for your loss," said Ordogan in the Classical Tongue. The Scholar Palatinae presented his water bottle before her. Her entire body told her that she had already heard his voice once, somewhere, some time. Her memory had reacted the same way when she saw Claradore on that horrible day. #emph[How?]

"My name is Nix, sir Scholae," said Nix who drank copiously from Ordogan’s bottle.

"Spoken like a native. She even puts Nosrau’s ambassadors to shame! Why don’t we sell her to the Magister Susurri? She could be of use to him at Persiphon," said one of the Molochians.

"She is a student of mine, not a slave," said Claradore dryly.

Ordogan ordered his men to start trekking. Nix found herself saddled by Claradore. Being on top of another animal, this was a sensation she had not foreseen. Her legs dangling in the open air, the smell of horse manure behind her, being taller than a man for once. The horse’s back made this sort of amateurish massage on her lower body. She smiled. If only Baba could see her at this moment.

"Why don’t we buy a horse," Nix had once asked Baba.

"A horse? What do I look like to you, my gold coin? An equestrian off to ride to battle with a Medean Emperor or with one of those kings from the New Kingdoms? See how you have difficulties potty training Spartak? A horse shits wherever it wants. There is no potty training for that kind of beast," had answered Baba.

Claradore embarked on the horse with her, taking the reins. Before she could even ask how fast they could go, the Molochians yelled one syllable. Her beast started galloping, her ass struggling to stay in contact with the saddle. Nix hugged Claradore for her dear life, her nails almost digging into his thick skin. It was as if she was running as a fox but without any semblance of control over the animal. The fact that it could run at this speed while carrying both her, Spartak and Claradore was flabbergasting. For the first time in a week, she giggled, hoping Baba could see her from beyond the Gates of the Underworld. #emph[I’m going to Thanatopolis after all, Baba.]

== Nix <ch:Nix07>
They smelled Thanatopolis before seeing it. It was logical that a metropolis that immense would sense their presence first and not the other way around. Miroconium had been characterized by the cow and horse manure whose odor would float by Baba’s house during summer days. In Thanatopolis’ case, she noticed one thing: chimneys. A lot of them. It had seemed the population’s entire supper flew in the air, the scent of tons of spices and oils coalescing with salt. Nix’ encyclopedias had told her that the city bore 300 000 inhabitants by the start of the previous century. Ordogan had corrected her: 500 000 souls now lived in it.

#emph[500 000! 500 times more than Miroconium!] How would all of them fit into the same space as Miroconium? She realized this was a stupid question once they reached Vitiatus’ Mount overlooking the peninsula. If a human’s jaw had any flexibility, hers must had reached its limit once Thanatopolis unraveled before her. #emph[Oh Baba!]

The artist had done a superb job at illustrating the imperial capital but no image could ever suffice to make a child comprehend the scale and size of the settlement. The aqueduct of Charov, glued in the corner of the page of her book, was actually this enormous brick serpent traversing the entirety of the city, streching beyond Vitiatus’ Mount. It ondulated making arches across rivers and the fortifications. To think humans could build such artificial snakes. She stood next to one its pillars, her mouth agape. A single of its supports was thrice as tall as Baba’s home, some delinquants having drawn graffiti of lower parts only men had. #emph[Idiots.]

Past the Marroan Walls, which she could see from at least fifteen kilometers away, was this entity that she only knew through literature. It separated continents, a mass of water, home to various animals she had seldom seen in fishmarkets. Only when one was next to it, the waves caressing one’s feet that one truly grasped how insignificant one was in their existence. For this seemingly endless body of fluid extended far beyond the horizon. So many of her books had theorized of laid beyond the boundaries of the Known World. From gigantic waterfalls leading to a starless void to an undiscovered continent to the spiritual realm that birthed the Goddess, no human, not even Baba had the answer to that.

And of course, Emperor Vitiatus had his capital built next to this entity. The Palace Complex she had heard multiple things about laid before her pupils, its five domes she wanted to replicate in her sketchbook. Right now, its white marble shone next to the glittering water, casting the illusion of a swan deploying its wings, a crown of gold reminding of all other beings of its magnificence. If only Nix still had that book. She had known the building as an ugly duckling, a mere almagalm of stones and bricks when it had hatched on the shores. #emph[So that is where all the fairy tales got their inspiration for their castles...]

Claradore put a hand on her shoulder. She smiled back at him. He pointed to the Marroans Walls. Baba had told her the tale of the Molochian Emperor Ultzindur who turned away with his tail between his legs at the sight of the battlements. Nix looked over to her Molochian companions. Instead of fearing the walls as she thought they would, they were playing dice with Ordogan, with pepper and salt on the line. Nix had counted a total of sixty towers, a number Ordogan confirmed, around thirty meters high.

"See...We will be safe here," said Claradore. She had no reason to doubt him. Baba always said they would flee to Thanatopolis if the Molochians ever returned. It had also been her first contact with a moat, something she only heard about in fairy tales. Three layers of walls were separated by two extensive moats which she imagined must contain crocodiles or hippos. Claradore had laughed at that suggestion, claiming the city workers were not paid handsomely enough to collect the resulting waste.

"We should go through the gates. I have sent couriers to the palace. The Emperor is expecting us," said Ordogan.

"We shall move when Nix is ready to do so," simply said Claradore much to Ordogan’s suprise.

"Do not worry, Scholae. The heir can wait. He will understand..."

And the houses. From her vantage point, she could contemplate the array of red, blue and green rooves, this kind of jungle where roses, violets, tulips, amaranths and orchids shared their existence. Those were all plants starting as different colored seeds, growing with roots which could be deep or shallow depending on their needs before sprouting with frail or strong penduncles. Yet to the human eye, the sole element that mattered was its beauty and what that was worth to each human differed. "Humans were flowers after all," said Baba. All vied for water and nutrients from the soil. All had vivid and dark colors under the myriad of seasons. Having a plethora of multicolored plants living and breathing in harmony was a testament to a gardener’s success. She thought of the bouquets Baba brought to Miroconium for sale and how her choice of colors reflected that of Thanatopolis.

#emph[Look at it Baba, how beautiful this all is.] She hoped Baba could hear her, wherever she was.

Another landmark Nix was glad to see in-person was the Hippodrome, this ellipsoidal structure that was six stories high and almost matched the Palace Complex in height. There was no shortage of vivid descriptions of races in her books. Baba had even forbade her to attend the one time Viroconium hosted hortse racing, having apparently herself gambled seventeen drachmas on a fair mare that ended up being beaten by the most hideous horse Baba had ever laid her eyes upon.

"Who is your favorite team, Claradore?" asked Nix.

"The Rubies, my dear." He saw her doubt him. There were only four teams at Thanatopolis: the Silvers, the Golds, the Emeralds and the Sapphires according to Baba. "We are new to horse racing, my dear Nix. As a matter of fact, I founded it a decade ago. We are almost as large as the Silvers and the Golds. The Goddess be exalted if we manage to lift the trophy this season."

"Pffft, do not let his propaganda fool you, child. The Rubies are but leagues away from the Golds in sheer talent. Last season, the Gold rider was at least two laps ahead of the Red rider," said Ordogan. Nix let out a playful laugh.

"Do not laugh, my dear! The Red rider...That was me!" said Claradore.

How long did she and Claradore spend gazing at the city that brightened its surroundings in no other manner as Thanatopolis…Even Spartak loafed next to her, sitting lazily and wagging its tail. Seeing the quadriremes and quinqueremes sail, their small silhouettes seeking refuge within the ramparts, was something she could do all day.

Only when hersand Spartak’s stomachs beckoned for food did Claradore allow the party to take them within the city. As they went down Vitiatus’ Mount, Thanatopolis’ size magnified as if she was looking through a looking glass, the towers and walls now intent on showcasing their menace instead of awe.

How much time would it take for her to climb them? Five minutes was all she needed to climb over Baba’s house. No, maybe seven minutes if Baba was below yelling at her to come down at once. These walls with their towers...Perhaps fifteen to twenty minutes for the smaller intermediary ramparts and half an hour for the colossal outer structure, one that spanned at least eight kilometers. Those towers provided a good lookout for watching the constellations at night. Nix would have to buy a backpack to carry Spartak when she climbed. She had no money but Claradore could give her some.

Miroconium never had a queue at its entrance nor did Baba’s house. In fact, queues should not exist according to Nix. Waiting to enter some place was an affront to anyone’s patience. Why should anyone wait to get in? At the Sombrae Gate, there were three hundred caravans in-line, men and women dressed in some of the most varied clothing she had seen in her lifetime, speaking in all the languages that ever existed. Patricians wearing purple tunics, merchants donning a mix of Rauthengardian, Elysian and Medean attires. Even children with Molochian fur hats were playing in the mud, their parents struggling to keep them away from the clear water moat. She was convinced they would only let them in at dusk. #emph[This is absurd. Why?]

"My dear, why are you complaining? You are not of age to understand the concept of customs and taxes," said Claradore.

"What are those?" she asked, Ordogan’s companions chuckling at her question. #emph[What is funny about that?]

"Have you ever wondered how the Sarviatarians built that aqueduct and those walls? It is with what we call taxes, a small amount of money every citizen has to give to the Emperor. For example, that road near Baba’s house. That was made using Baba’s money, my dear Nix," said Claradore.

"Oooooooooooh!" She now knew why Baba loathed seeing that one man who knocked once every year at their door. The thief in prince’s clothing she would call him. Everytime, she would bake him biscuits. He always protested but ate the cookies nonetheless and went back empty-handed. It was someone Claradore told her was a tax collector.

Ordogan went ahead of the group, with a scroll in-hand. Nix saw the Limitanei at the gates saluting him before he motioned them to skip the line. #emph[Humans are not made for lines anyways.]

What caught her attention as she stepped into Thanatopolis’ walls was the ocean of humanity that flowed within narrow streets. Brown water rushed below stepping stones at intersections, no one needing to explain to her why those were required. Her group swam on this body of warmth and sweat, among the other schools of fish that somehow found their way amidst the divergent streams. Claradore pushed her at almost every step. The amount of details she had to take into account. Food stands waving at her to sell some sort of shrimp dumplings which smelled like the heavens to both her and Spartak, orators preaching the Faith’s scriptures, picturesque houses where women sprayed perfume from their balconies. A cacophony of donkeys, horses, shouts, prayers and other children bumping into her met her hearing. In contrast to the quietude of Baba’s house, here she would never be alone.

Nix had to stop when they reached the Hippodrome. Each of the arches in the arcades framed statues painted even more meticulously than those found in Miroconium. She recognized the Goddess, Emperor Vitiatius and his dove sitting on his lap marking his conversion to the Faith, Empress Zenobia with her four meters tall sarissa. To think that 80 000 people could be seated here the last time Baba had been here. The most mind-boggling story from her encyclopedia was that the Sarvitarians had simulated sea battles using the Hippodrome. In fact, Baba had watched a re-enactment of the Battle of Thunegard between the ailing Regnassian Empire and the ascending Sarvitarian Empire, her stories of how the stadium was filled with water and how the boats were carried into the premises filled Nix with jealousy

Threading in this sea of humans, she saw the Palace Complex creeping ever closer. The Sarvitarian and their successor states, the Medean and Tiarmat Empires, prided their rulers as being descendants of pagan gods. It was only when one was faced with the stunning colonnaded corridors leading to the hundred of marble stairs, free of any dust particle that one could believe that one dealt with divinities.

"See that building there my dear Nix, that will be your new home?" said Claradore.

#emph[Palace? Wait I do not understand...]

"I have long promised Baba that I would provide you the wings you need to soar in this world. After all, we who have seen the Gates of the Underworld must stay close to another, should we not?" said Claradore.

The palace, full of lavish dining rooms serving portions equivalent to five dinners with Baba. The palace, containing this extensive wardrobe for the Emperor under a Magister Sacra Vestis. She had read about the costumes designed for Medean royalty. The most wonderful was this purple gown on which a lady could wear a golden brocade laden with rich phoenix motifs she had aspired to own on the day of her wedding. She would give anything to be able to try out those outfits in front of the mirror or for someone to make a sculpture of her while wearing them.

She knew however that there was only one way to be able to commission as many fancy dresses as she pleased. A dream Baba had laughed in derision countless of times the past two years. Yet Baba could never imagine that Claradore would find her nor that they would live here.

"There is only one woman in the Known World who has a flagrance unique to her. That same lady can order clothes made of silk traded from the Unknown World with dyes extracted from snails living underwater. Those ball gowns, my gold coin, cost the totality of the Cachalot Kingdom’s treasury and are the envy of all young ladies in the Known World. Who is that woman?" had asked Baba.

"The Medean Empress," had said Nix.
