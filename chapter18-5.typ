Serena ignored the blood dripping from her stomach. Erfan would have said that she deserved this throbbing pain. There was truth in his words. Dawn began lighting Thanatopolis' domes. Pelicans soared next to her. In more than a millennium of existence, Serena has never seen the sun shine as majestically as it did this morning. Was every morning as radiant as this one? She has forgotten.

_I am sorry Phoenix Wing,_ thought Serena.

In her arms was cradled Nix who was now a calcined husk of her former self. 
It was too soon for her to face Alexander. Serena should have ended his life 
when she had the chance. She had seen first hand how his devotion and admiration 
transformed him, but her younger self had found it endearing. A grave mistake. 
It was only when he led armies in her name, razing cities and towns that survived the conquest that she had begun to question his resolve. In sparing the last Giant, she had allowed him to take Erfan away from her and now...Nix as well.

Nix vomited blood on Serena's tattered tunic. Below them, the crystalline sea 
stretched from the peninsula of Thanator to the Aeotian Islands. It was an ideal coffin. The sea was after all guilty of murdering, men, beasts, ships and empires alike. What were two more women to its staggering record? 

"Se...rena?" croaked Nix.

"Who else could it be, Phoenix Wing?"

"You...You..are the Goddess."

Serena smiled, trying to mask her aching wound. The mere act to crisping her lips sent a torrent of agony through her spine."Some in this world do call me that."

"You...never told me."

"You never asked."

"So it was all a lie?"

Serena planted a kiss on Nix's forehead, the sour taste of pus filling her tongue.

"It was never a lie, sweet sister. I merely protected you from the unpleasantness of truth."

"Nothing of what you said makes sense."

"We were sisters a thousand years ago...I have failed you back then. I cannot afford to have the Gatekeeper strip you away from me a second time, Phoenix Wing."

"I will die, won't I?"

That question lodged blades within Serena's heart. On the eve of the Final War of the Magi, Serena had answered yes while strangling her twin sister. All for one 
man's heart. She remembered kissing Regnant the Dragonslayer who had seemed the embodiment of perfection back then atop the Hill of Perdiccaeum.

"The day has come, my Lady?" had asked the Nameless Slave after Serena had kissed Regnant the Dragonslayer.

"The day has come. No longer will the non-Magi live under the Magi’s thrall," had answered Serena before the army of freed slaves they had amassed below the verdant mount and the field of crags and edelweisses. She had raised her banner, the white dove, the colors of her plumage which had infatuated her lover.

"Does it excite you? To be labelled as a traitor by your own kin," had said Regnant the Dragonslayer.

"Messiahs cannot be traitors."

The day had come then. Another day where she would stand in the middle of two misshapen columns built with countless corpses. Her first painting, one she had co-authored with Regnant the Dragonslayer, one that had loomed impossibly high. A necessity it had been to fuse the Magi’s bodies using flesh and bone as cement into these writhing towers from which faces emerged. Magi had once prided themselves into being able to manipulate flesh as if it was paint, metal or stone. Therefore, Serena and her followers had dedicated this monument that twisted upwards in an unnatural spiral to the vanquished. It was there that Serena had attained godhood.

Nix's wails of agony returned Serena to the present.

"Do you remember the tavern, Phoenix Wing? We should have left the capital then."

Nix did not answer the question. Her breath reeked of blood and scorched organs.
A younger Serena would have put her out of her misery. Serena wanted to laugh. 
Alexander and the Nameless Slave had spoken the truth plainly. Old age softened the hearts of all.

Serena ceased flying. A dove approached them, one that carried Nix's unlocked 
medallion. It was her obligation to return it.

"Your medallion, Phoenix Wing."

Nix's eyes showed both incomprehension and hatred simultaneously. 
The dove deposited the artifact within Serena's palm. Within the medallion laid 
a signet, one that bore the seal of an Elysian Empress. The Elysian gryphon was carved on the ring.  But what caught Nix's eye as Serena expected was the engraving encircling the Elysian beast: to the daughter of Aishula and Nosrau, the Emperor of Kings, may the prophecy light your way.

"I did not want you to know... You would have enacted the prophecy," said Serena.

"The Goddess believes in prophecies... Madness."

"Prophecies preclude the Age of Magic. They are not to be taken lightly."

A dog barked beneath her. Spartak. Another mistake Nix had made was not to bring her dog to the Exiles's Island. Serena had never told Nix about its true origins. She panted as she landed on the shores of the imperial capital. The contents of her failing guts invaded her nose. Serena cursed. There was so much she wanted to discuss with Nix now that Serena became the Goddess anew. 

Serena put Nix on Spartak's back.

"You know what to do."

Spartak barked, sprinting for Thanatopolis' walls. Serena smiled. A cool breeze 
brushed her bloodied hair. This has been a beautiful 
millennium of existence. She closed her eyes and slumped on the ground. 
She slept tasting blood in her throat. Rocks had never felt so soft.
