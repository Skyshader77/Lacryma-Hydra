Serena ignored the blood dripping from her stomach. Erfan would have said that she deserved this throbbing pain. There was truth in his words. Dawn began lighting Thanatopolis' domes. Pelicans soared next to her. In more than a millennium of existence, Serena has never seen the sun shine as majestically as it did this morning. Was every morning as radiant as this one? She has forgotten.

_I am sorry Phoenix Wing,_ thought Serena.

Her wings flapped with the vigor of a cancerous patient. Every imperial mile 
she traversed felt as if her entire body had done a marathon. Every breath was a wheeze.

In her arms was cradled Nix who was now a calcined husk of her former self. 
It was too soon for her to face Sixtus. Serena should have ended his life 
when she had the chance. She had seen first hand how his devotion and admiration 
transformed him, but her younger self had found it endearing. A grave mistake. 
It was only when he led armies in her name, razing cities and towns that survived the conquest that she had begun to question his resolve. In sparing the last Giant, she had allowed him to take Erfan away from her and now...Nix as well.

Nix vomited blood on Serena's tattered tunic. Below them, the crystalline sea 
stretched from the peninsula of Thanator to the Aeotian Islands. It was an ideal coffin. The sea was after all guilty of murdering, men, beasts, ships and empires alike. What were two more women to its staggering record? 

"Se...rena?" croaked Nix. The voice stank of suffering. It was unimaginable that 
this would be the last time Serena heard her own name.

"Who else could it be, Phoenix Wing?"

"You...You..are the Goddess."

Serena smiled, trying to mask her aching wound. The mere act to crisping her lips sent a torrent of agony through her spine."Some in this world do call me that."

"You...never told me."

"You never asked."

"So it was all a lie?"

Serena planted a kiss on Nix's forehead, the sour taste of pus filling her tongue.
_I am sorry..._

"It was never a lie, sweet sister. I merely protected you from the unpleasantness of truth."

"Nothing of what you said makes sense."

"We were sisters a thousand years ago...I have failed you back then. I cannot afford to have the Gatekeeper strip you away from me a second time, Phoenix Wing."

"I will die, won't I?"

That question lodged blades within Serena's heart. On the eve of the Final War of the Magi, Serena had answered yes while strangling her twin sister. All for one 
man's heart. She remembered kissing Regnant the Dragonslayer who had seemed the embodiment of perfection back then atop the Hill of Perdiccaeum.

"The day has come, my Lady?" had asked the Nameless Slave after Serena had kissed Regnant the Dragonslayer.

"The day has come. No longer will the non-Magi live under the Magi’s thrall," had answered Serena before the army of freed slaves they had amassed below the verdant mount and the field of crags and edelweisses. She had raised her banner, the white dove, the colors of her plumage which had infatuated her lover.

"Does it excite you? To be labelled as a traitor by your own kin," had said Regnant the Dragonslayer.

"Messiahs cannot be traitors."

The day had come then. Another day when she would stand in the middle of two misshapen columns built with countless corpses. Her first painting, one she had co-authored with Regnant the Dragonslayer, one that had loomed impossibly high. A necessity it had been to fuse the Magi’s bodies using flesh and bone as cement into these writhing towers from which faces emerged. Magi had once prided themselves into being able to manipulate flesh as if it was paint, metal or stone. Therefore, Serena and her followers had dedicated this monument that twisted upwards in an unnatural spiral to the vanquished. It was there that Serena had attained godhood.

Nix's wails of agony returned Serena to the present.

"Do you remember the tavern, Phoenix Wing? We should have left the capital then."

Serena still remembered the liquor, the braised duck that was served by the servants, the warmth of the boar skins covering their seats. The Magi had never 
discovered how one could stop the cruel passage of time. Serena had thought that 
immortality would have allowed to preserve the present. Instead, her era spanning existence has made her lose her comprehension of the concept of time. What good was being immortal if all of your friends, lovers and children would see the Gates of the Underworld before you? Yet, all children in the Known World chased 
a deathless life. From drinking mercury to consulting charlatans, emperors and kings always tried to lose the race to the afterlife. 

Nix did not answer the question. Her breath reeked of blood and scorched organs.
A younger Serena would have put her out of her misery. Serena wanted to laugh. 
Sixtus and the Nameless Slave had spoken the truth plainly. Old age softened the hearts of all.

Serena ceased flying. A dove approached them, one that carried Nix's unlocked 
medallion. It was her obligation to return it.

"Your medallion, Phoenix Wing," said Serena as she wrapped the medallion around Nix's neck.

Nix's eyes showed both incomprehension and hatred simultaneously. 
The dove deposited the artifact within Serena's palm. Within the medallion laid 
a signet, one that bore the seal of an Elysian Empress. The Elysian gryphon was carved on the ring.  But what caught Nix's eye as Serena expected was the engraving encircling the Elysian beast: to the daughter of Aishula and Nosrau, the Emperor of Kings, may the prophecy light your way.

"It would seem Majorian was not jesting, Phoenix Wing or should I say, Princess of Kings."

"Why?" said Nix.

"I did not want you to know... You would have enacted the prophecy. There are many in the Elysian Empire who would have acclaimed you. You would have been swallowed by wars waged in your name. Some things are better left unknown to the common of mortals," said Serena.

"The Goddess believes in prophecies... Madness."

"Prophecies preclude the Age of Magic. They are the oldest form of magic and are not to be taken lightly."

"Ludicrous. Absolutely ludicrous. You think me capable of conquest?"

Serena touched Nix's wounded hands, the latter's blood clinging to her own 
bloody palm. "I have seen the games you play with Majorian. I have seen how your eyes brighten when you wear a crown. Those were the eyes of someone yearning for unadulterated power. You can be dreadful at times, Phoenix Wing."

"Have you lost the aptitude of logic? How is aspiring to change the world frightening to your kind?"

"I have walked the path you are intending to walk. It will rob you of empathy as it did with me."

"I understand. You do not want me to tamper with your canvas. Canvasses are where we should strive to chase flawlessness."

Serena shook her head. 
"Yet blemishes allow the artist to display their humanity."

"Faults are never contained to a single element of the painting. You have seen how hurtful a single stain can be. What do you see in faults that contaminate the colors, the highlights, the shadows and the varnish?"

"Yes, as irredeemable as these limitations are, they are a primordial part of human nature."

"Yet clemency towards these inadequacies taint the legacy of the artist. What would you say to the connoisseurs who question your integrity?"

"It is always easier to condemn tactics from a villa’s lounge. When one plunges in the battlefield that is a painting, one must surrender their childish delusion that all defects can be repaired. For the first casualty of ambition is one’s sanity."

"Defeatism is a poor master."

"Is this how you treat my canvas, the one that has granted you life for the past twenty years?"

"I will enhance it. By the time I will have redone its horrible colors and faces, it would be unrecognizable."

"Then, enlighten me. All children of this world are born with the ardent desire to become the heroes and heroines of a renowned painting, one which would revolutionize the art of painting itself. The wide majority end up drawing a plain canvas. Why not settle for simplicity, Phoenix Wing? We could have produced our own work of art if we traveled to Unknown World."

Nix spat a mouthful of blood. "Simplicity? SIMPLICITY? There is no simplicity when one is a Magi."

The watchtowers of the Marroan Walls were now visible in great detail. Serena saw guards loitering at their posts playing children's card games. She pitied them for they would soon have to reckon with the existence of monsters again. They would clamor for her name and she would never answer again.

Serena lowered her altitude. The denizens of Thanatopolis living in this section of the ramparts were cooking curries perfumed with coriander and baking honey laced pancakes. If only she could eat. She remembered the last meal Nix and her had cooked: this roasted duck with thymes and a white wine based sauce that spent twelve minutes in the imperial oven beneath their apartment. 

A dog barked beneath her. Spartak. Another mistake Nix had made was not to bring her dog to the Exiles's Island. Serena had never told Nix about its true origins. She panted as she landed on the shores of the imperial capital. The contents of her failing guts invaded her nose. Serena cursed. There was so much she wanted to discuss with Nix now that Serena became the Goddess anew. 

"This is where our paths diverge, Phoenix Wing."

"Your wounds..."

Serena used her last reserves of strength to produce the smile she always showed before Nix. "You Magi have inflicted much worse on me."

"You lie. You were a vain Goddess. You did not save Baba, me nor Majorian."

"It is not the duty of the Goddess to save everyone."

"Worthless! All of your lies are worthless!"

"Do you doubt it, then? My love for you, sweet sister?"

"Love? You call this love? It is no wonder you were alone for a millennium. The whole world rejects you, Serena. The Gatekeeper have mercy on you."

Serena put Nix on Spartak's back.

"You know what to do," said Serena to Spartak.

Spartak barked, sprinting for Thanatopolis' inner walls. Nix roared in pain on its back. Serena smiled. At least the life of her dear sister would be spared. A cool breeze 
brushed Serena's bloodied hair. This has been a beautiful 
millennium of existence. She closed her eyes and slumped on the ground. _Erfan...I am coming...I am coming, my son..._
She slept tasting blood in her throat. Rocks had never felt so soft. A wave caressed her bleeding cheek. She saw herself as a child again, a curious girl who touched the magical toys her parents gifted her and Nix. She witnessed the forbidden kiss she gave the past Nix under a starry sky and the outrage it ignited in their parents. Love. Love for Nix. Love for Regnant the DragonSlayer. Love for Erfan. Everything she had done was in the name of love. In the end, love carried her to the river of souls. The Gates of Hell stood before her.
