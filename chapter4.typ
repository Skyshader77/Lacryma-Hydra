Her arms melted first. She concentrated her thoughts around her very self. When one performed magic, it was imperative that the soul must resonate with the body. Baba had told her that much. #emph[Breathe...Slowly...Relax] The first time, her body had been too stiff, preventing the magic from coursing through her veins. Nix heard the grass rustle on this uneventful morning. She no longer smelled the cow manure coming from the village. Curtains of red descended from her eyelids. The play had started. She felt her head melt. Voices, male and female whispered in her head. Some of them spoke in the Classical Tongue, others in the Imperial Tongue. There was one tongue, though, one elusive language which she had never deciphered. It always said one word. Three syllabes.

To conduct magic was to travel through the plane of one’s existence. Nix witnessed again the time Baba gave her a book on the Conquests of Magnavalon, where the modern day Clovians now occupied. She remembered how perplexed she had been seeing all these characters strung along that Baba made sounds with. To start with the Classical Tongue was to master all other languages, save that one tongue. It whispered again the word. #emph[What does it mean?]

Her neck liquified, then her torso. Her legs supported nothing. She let them fade away as well. The sensation of being unaffected by gravity. Nix failed to describe it. She moved on the soil as swiftly as the deadliest vipers, as silently as a wolf stalking its prey, as naturally as a waterfall.

She flowed, wanting to become a river that followed its natural course. Her flesh went down hills, cascading upon pebbles and rocks, mice, beetles evading her current form. The limitations of a solid state befuddled her. A fact Nix had not accepted was that everyday people went on without being able to traverse the most simple of obstacles. Lock or not, doors could be defeated by going beneath them. All walls had holes and tears, created by years of decades of wear. Here, Nix could sashay between twigs, masquerade as a shadow, enter ants’ nest. A sense of unattainable freedom. Freedom from the hardness of materials, freedom from tangible barriers. Nix laughed, her body not even being able to make a single sound at this very instant.

She swore. She cursed. She yelled. Nothing. Nothing but peace and the sound of nature calling. Nix heard all from the foxes doing their mating call, the larks and pigeons singing their odes from their balconies of branches to the cicadas conducting their symphonies by the use of their miniature timbals. As a liquid, the animal kingdom welcomed her with open arms like Baba did at home. Nix giggled, turning her form towards a glowing stream.

Diving into the river, water and blood became one. Nix closed what were her eyes, letting the stream rock her being. Her soul swayed upstream, downstream, left and right. A multitude of droplets massaged her body. If she had any worries coming into the river, they had been dissipated. Such was the uniqueness of merging one’s existence with water, a fluid that was quintessential to life, One of the five elements according to Baba. The Faith said The Goddess created water from her saliva. All humans being children of the Goddess meant that all kissed their mother when drinking water. #emph[How poetic.] It was in this mental state that Nix wondered if she had ever tasted her mother’s water.

"Who is my mother?" Nix had asked Baba once. Baba’s face was afflicted by such pain that Nix had never dared to bring up the topic again. It had been one of the rare times Baba’s voice failed to find any words, similar to someone having stabbed her in the groin. The pain. Nix had never forgotten Baba’s eyes as pitiful as a lost kitten’s. Then, she had learned that adults could cry.

Mother. A word Baba had refused to let herself be referred to as. Nix had accepted that as a fact.

Father. Men never came to Baba’s house. In fact, she had never spoken more than a sentence to any man. Buying bread and trading fur in the village were her only occasions to interact with them. Nix knew everyone had a mother and a father. Some children played with them games she had played with Baba.

"Who is my father?" she had asked Baba, hoping the answer would be Claradore.

"A putrid mess like Claradore and all men," answered Baba who would often cry out a man’s name in her sleep, her voice ridden with righteous anger. Nix had heard the violent thuds when Baba kicked her bed’s frame while cursing. From what she could guess, Baba’s fairy tale wedding happened in a time when Baba could be imagined as young, a mental image Nix could never hope to form inside her head. Her charming prince plucked Baba’s petals, gifting them to another flower, one less eloquent and less ravishing, leaving only the thorns to Baba. Nix’ intended name for Spartak had been his name. She would never forget how Baba berated that name for two long hours.

As for Claradore...A name Baba had wanted to teach her as the synonym of male disappointment. When Nix came to the village, she had been surprised to learn that this meaning was Baba’s invention and not a current idiom.

"Was he a good magician?" she had asked Baba.

"The best, my gold coin. I have never seen anyone like him. The Known World thinks us Magi are extinct. Claradore is living proof The Faith has lied for centuries," said Baba.

"Then, he can teach me magic! He should know how to breath fire from my lungs like your books show!"

"And have you follow the same path of shame that he did? Not a chance, my gold coin, you are too valuable to this old woman," said Baba as she buried Nix ’s head in her arms. "Losing another to the vices of magic...I do not know if I will have the strength to relive that."

Water thrashed around her. Something howled horribly. Her vision was confronted by a fox, its fur as bright as a sunrise. She felt herself enter its body through its tongue. Nix screamed. Nothing came out. The fox’ squeals grew ever horrendous, their ringing screeching in what were her ears. Her body flailed, contorting itself in an abrupt manner. Lungs, throat, stomach, every fiber of the mammal’s body absorbed her essence whether both of them approved of it or not. She did not understand. None of her books ever drew this scenario.

Nix saw a combination of black and red swimming before her eyes. Everything around her twirled violently. Her head spun. She struggled to maintain control. Control. Control of what, she asked. The world turned and turned at an increasing velocity and so did her soul and flesh within the fox’ insides.

She awoke in a starry void. Galaxies and planets orbiting around her. Her hands. They had materialized. Nix touched her face. Skin. Solid flesh. #emph[Where am I?] Her feet dangled in mid air, neither feeling cold nor tepid. No wind, no soil, no water, only emptiness greeted both her toes and her fingers.

A boy stood before her, a tarantula tattooed on his back, drawn in the same style as Claradore’s.

"You have done it, my dear," said the boy in the Classical Tongue. An accent she had never heard. They were around the same age yet this feeling...She could not ascertain it but he seemed older.

"Who are you?" she asked.

"That is not important right now, my dear," he said, making a grin that managed to draw and repel her at the same time. #emph[What do I make of this?] One step backwards. One step forward. Flee or approach. What did her body desire? Even Nix could not solve that dilemma. Seeing her reaction, the boy smiled in a tender way, one that copied Baba’s kindness. He glowed, radiating this known homeliness that made her heart beat with anticipation. #emph[A friend?] She took a step towards him.

"Do you know what you have even accomplished just now, my dear?" said the boy.

He spoke in riddles and she disliked riddles. "Why do you call me my dear and what are you babbling about?"

"You have yet to realize it, my dear Nix, but you have paved the way for our ultimate triumph."

"I don’t understand, what are you talking about? And how do you know my name?"

"Breathe...Then open your eyes. You will see what the True Goddess has in store for someone as unique as you, my dear," said the boy. He clapped his hands, causing Nix’ body to gasp for air. #emph[It hurts.] Her lungs seared from the inside out, the boy lit a wildfire within them. She tried to breathe. The galaxies and planets hovering around her disappeared in a white flash while the boy fell apart, reduced to dust.

An orange paw greeted her eyes when she could open them again. Water. She was before the river again. Nix howled at her own reflection and so did the fox gazing back at her. #emph[Impossible! How did this...] Her being swallowed by the animal. The boy’s cryptic words. Astonishment and clarity clashed over her mind.

Nix showed her tongue and teeth. The fox followed. She raised a paw. The animal copied her move. What had transpired could not have been possible but reality now disappointed her in another way. She made the fox lick its claws and wag its tail. #emph[This...How? Why?]

#emph[Drink.] Water tasted the same as a fox, somewhat upsetting her. With her new ears, the stream now seemed to roar within the confines of its bed. Even the shy rabbits and peaceful cicadas bellowed instead of making gentle sounds. Her mind could deduce even the distance to the nearer rabbit, a thought that would had never crossed her as a human. #emph[Splendid! I must tell Baba about this!]

She ran. Treelines, bushes, protruding roots, all zoomed in front of the fox’ eyesight. Her speed amazed her, being four to fives times faster than when sprinting as a human. Nix ordered the fox to do joyous barks, having run around the river for an incalculable amount of time. Time. A concept she was sure animals had no idea of. Her mind could not tell her how many minutes nor hours she had spent loafing around in this body. She rolled on the trail, licking the mud off her fur, tasting mushrooms and berries Baba forbade her to eat, chased after rodents as small as her hand. The ability to spot any mouse hidden in the densest vegetation baffled her.

Nix found herself resting on the banks of the river, her mouth panting in profusion, only growing alarmed when her eyes stared at the ending sunset. #emph[How do I exit this?] The fox’s heartbeat accelerated. Its legs and head convulsed, its mouth made dreadful sounds. Blood raced from one organ to another. Nix listened to it: the flow. She felt it anew. Nix had to become one with the water again. She closed her eyes, allowing herself to be ferried.

Before long, she found herself face down on cold sand with a sore throat. She coughed and vomited, spilling mucus all over herself. The rest of her body ached. Hands and feet tingled as she readjusted to having a physical body. Blood. Her nose bled. Baba would scold her again on top of returning to the house without her clothes. #emph[I am in so much trouble. What will I say to her?]

Next to her, the fox rasped as if it was dying, vomiting in abundance. Never would she forget how fast it scurried away from her when it noticed her presence.
